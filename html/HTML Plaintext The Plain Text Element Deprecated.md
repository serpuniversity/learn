# `<plaintext>`: The Plain Text element (Deprecated)

The `<plaintext>` element once held the promise of rendering HTML code as plain text, offering a simple solution to display source code and documentation without interpretation. However, its implementation was inconsistent across browsers, and modern web development has moved beyond its capabilities. This article examines the `<plaintext>` element's functionality, technical implementation, and why it has been deprecated in favor of more robust alternatives like `<pre>` and `<code>` elements, while also discussing best practices for serving plain text content.


## What is the `<plaintext>` element?

The `<plaintext>` element was used to render HTML code as plain text. This element causes all text following its opening tag to be displayed as raw text, completely ignoring any subsequent HTML markup. Importantly, the `<plaintext>` element has no closing tag â€“ everything after the opening tag is treated as plain text. This element was first introduced in HTML 2 but has been deprecated since then, with modern browsers treating it inconsistently and often rendering it incorrectly.

The element implements the HTMLElement interface and supports global attributes, though it has limited functionality compared to modern text-displaying elements. Before Firefox 4, it implemented the HTMLSpanElement interface instead of the standard HTMLElement interface. This element was primarily designed to display source code and other text that should be displayed exactly as it is written, without HTML interpretation.

As web development standards evolved, better alternatives emerged for displaying plain text. For rendering monospaced text, developers now recommend using the `<pre>` element. For inline text that needs to be displayed as code, the `<code>` element is the recommended replacement. To prevent browsers from interpreting specific text as HTML, developers should escape special characters like <, >, and & to ensure they are displayed as plain text.


## How does the `<plaintext>` element work?

The `<plaintext>` element renders all text following its opening tag as raw text, completely ignoring any subsequent HTML markup. This behavior is consistent across browsers that support the element, though implementation details vary.

According to the HTML specification, the element implements the HTMLElement interface and supports global attributes. However, before Firefox 4, it implemented the HTMLSpanElement interface instead of the standard HTMLElement interface. This difference in implementation can affect how the element is processed in older browsers.

When used in a document, the `<plaintext>` element extends to the end of the document, as it has no closing tag. Browsers that implement this element typically treat everything after the opening tag as raw text, rendering HTML markup as literal text rather than interpreting it as HTML.

For example, consider the following HTML snippet:

```html

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">

<html>

<head>

<title>Plaintext Example</title>

</head>

<body>

The rest of this file is in plain text.

<plaintext>

Even though this is supposed to be <b>bold</b>, the tags still show. There is no way to turn plain text off once it is on. <plaintext> does nothing to help. Even <b>/body</b> and <b>/html</b> will show up.

</body>

</html>

```

In this example, all text within the `<body>` element, including the `<plaintext>` element itself, would be rendered as plain text, with the bold tags appearing as literal text.


### Technical Implementation Details

The element's implementation varies between browsers and versions. While the specification requires no closing tag, some older browsers may treat the `<plaintext>` element as a `<pre>` element that still interprets HTML. For instance, if `<plaintext>` is the first element on the page (excluding non-displayed elements like `<head>`), browsers may treat it as a `<pre>` element instead.

To prevent browsers from interpreting specific text as HTML, developers should escape special characters like <, >, and & to ensure they are displayed as plain text. For example, the character sequence `<b>` would need to be escaped as &lt;b&gt; to prevent the browser from interpreting it as HTML.

In modern web development, this functionality can be achieved through alternative approaches. For rendering monospaced text, developers should use the `<pre>` element. For inline text that needs to be displayed as code, the `<code>` element is the recommended replacement.

Despite its utility in certain contexts, the `<plaintext>` element has limited functionality compared to modern text-displaying elements. Its use is not recommended, and browsers may treat it inconsistently, particularly when serving text files. For server-side implementation, developers should serve plain text files with the text/plain MIME-type to ensure proper rendering.


## Browser Support and Compatibility

The `<plaintext>` element has limited browser support, with inconsistent implementation across different versions and platforms. While some older browsers may still recognize and partially support its functionality, modern web development best practices clearly recommend against its use.

According to the HTML specification, browsers that accept the `<plaintext>` element may instead treat it as a `<pre>` element that still interprets HTML within. This behavior can lead to unpredictable rendering, particularly when the `<plaintext>` element appears as the first node in the document (excluding non-displayed elements like `<head>`).

For server-side implementation of plain text rendering, HTML5 recommends serving text files with the text/plain MIME-type instead of using `<plaintext>`. This approach ensures consistent rendering across all browsers while maintaining the desired plain text display functionality.

The element's limited implementation details and lack of consistent behavior make it unsuitable for inclusion in new web development projects. Developers should opt for alternative elements like `<code>` or `<pre>` to achieve similar functionality while ensuring proper rendering and maintenance compatibility.


## Alternatives to `<plaintext>`

For displaying monospaced text, developers should use the `<pre>` element. This element achieves the same functionality as `<plaintext>` while providing better compatibility and support across modern browsers. The `<pre>` element preserves whitespace and line breaks, making it suitable for displaying code snippets and formatted text.

Inline text that needs to be displayed as code should use the `<code>` element instead of `<plaintext>`. The `<code>` element is specifically designed for code snippets and provides appropriate semantic meaning to screen readers and other accessibility tools. To display plain text while preventing browsers from interpreting specific characters, developers should escape special characters like <, >, and & using HTML entity codes.

For server-side implementation of plain text rendering, HTML5 recommends serving text files with the text/plain MIME-type. This approach ensures consistent rendering across all browsers while maintaining the desired plain text display functionality. This method is particularly useful when displaying source code, configuration files, or other text that should be displayed exactly as written.

The choice between `<pre>` and `<code>` depends on the specific use case:

- Use `<pre>` when displaying formatted text that should be rendered in a monospaced font, such as code snippets or configuration files.

- Use `<code>` when displaying inline code snippets or text that should be styled as code, with appropriate semantic meaning for accessibility.

By adopting these modern alternatives, developers can achieve the same functionality as `<plaintext>` while ensuring better compatibility and maintainability in their web projects.


## Technical Details

The `<plaintext>` element implements the HTMLElement interface and supports global attributes, providing access to the same metadata properties as other HTML elements. This includes attributes for title, language (lang), translation (translate), and text direction (dir), all of which can be accessed through the standard HTMLElement interface.

The element's interface also includes user interaction attributes such as title, lang, translate, and dir, making it consistent with other HTML elements in terms of metadata and accessibility features. While these attributes may not affect rendering behavior, they provide important metadata that can influence how the content is processed and displayed by assistive technologies and content management systems.

From a technical perspective, the `<plaintext>` element has no additional functionality beyond the basic HTMLElement interface. It does not implement any specific behaviors or methods beyond those available to all HTML elements, making it a straightforward implementation of the standard interface with no unique features.
