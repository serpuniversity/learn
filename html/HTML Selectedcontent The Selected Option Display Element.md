# The `<selectedcontent>` HTML Element

To create dropdown menus that go beyond basic text options, developers need new tools for displaying rich content. The `<selectedcontent>` element fills this gap by allowing images, icons, and custom HTML in dropdown interfaces. This article explores how `<selectedcontent>` works with `<select>` elements, its technical requirements, and how to use it while maintaining form functionality.


## Overview

The `<selectedcontent>` element has been designed as a direct response to the limitations of traditional dropdown menus, particularly in how option content is displayed and styled. This new HTML construct allows developers to insert rich content directly into dropdown interfaces, including icons, images, and custom HTML elements.

The element works by creating a clone of the selected `<option>` element's content using the cloneNode() method, which means that developers can include complex structures within their dropdown options while still maintaining consistent behavior with standard `<select>` elements. For instance, if an `<option>` contains an image, the `<selectedcontent>` element will display this image alongside the text, allowing for more visually engaging dropdown interfaces without disrupting the underlying functionality.

To manage rendering and styling, `<selectedcontent>` requires both opening and closing tags and must be a button element that serves as the first child of a `<select>` element. This structure ensures that the selected content behaves correctly within the broader form context while providing developers with the flexibility to customize the visual presentation of their dropdown options.


## Element Structure and Requirements

The `<selectedcontent>` element requires both the starting and ending tags to be present and must be a button element that is the first child of a select element. This structure enables it to function correctly within the broader form context while providing developers with the flexibility to customize the visual presentation of their dropdown options.


### Technical Requirements

The element must be nested inside a button element that serves as the first child of a select element. This specific parent relationship is crucial for proper behavior and accessibility. Any attempt to place the `<selectedcontent>` element inside another `<selectedcontent>` element can cause issues, such as incorrect rendering or layout problems. To address these potential problems, developers can use CSS to hide problematic content, as demonstrated by the following example:

```css

.selectedcontent img {

  display: none;

}

```


### Implementation Considerations

While the element mirrors content from the selected `<option>` element, developers should be aware of limitations in styling options directly using CSS. The `<option>` tag behaves as a "replaced element" that is OS-dependent and cannot be fully styled with CSS beyond basic properties like background-color and color. For more complex styling requirements, developers may need to rely on alternative approaches, such as replacing the select element with custom HTML structures and implementing select functionality through JavaScript.


### Example Structure

A valid implementation would look like this:

```html

<select>

  <button>

    <selectedcontent></selectedcontent>

  </button>

  <option>First Option</option>

  <option>Second Option</option>

</select>

```

This structure ensures that the selected content behaves correctly within the select element while allowing developers to customize the visual presentation of their options through proper HTML and CSS practices.


## Content Display and Styling

The selected content element mirrors the structure of the currently selected `<option>` element using the cloneNode() method, enabling developers to include icons, images, and complex HTML content within dropdown menus. The element's content is updated automatically when the selected option changes, replacing the previous content with a cloned copy of the new selection's DOM structure.

To style the selected content effectively while maintaining proper display, developers should wrap the `<selectedcontent>` element in a `<button>` tag, which serves as its parent. This structure ensures that interactive elements within the `<selectedcontent>` function correctly as a single button while allowing for custom styling. For example, the following approach demonstrates how to hide problematic content using CSS:

```css

.selectedcontent img {

  display: none;

}

```

The element's content display requires developers to understand several key technical aspects:

1. Content Categories: Flow content, phrasing content, interactive content, listed, labelable, resettable, submittable

2. Form Association: The element is form-associated, meaning it is part of a form submission

3. Permitted Content: The element can contain zero or more `<option>`, `<optgroup>`, or `<hr>` elements

4. Tag Requirements: Both the starting and ending tags are mandatory

5. Parent Elements: The element must be a button that is the first child of a select element

These technical specifications ensure consistent behavior across different implementations while providing developers with flexibility in content creation and styling.


## Browser Compatibility and Implementation

As of now, the `<selectedcontent>` element is not part of any official specification, with its development tracked through a pull request on the WHATWG HTML repository. Browser compatibility information is not yet available, though developers can test implementation status using the linked GitHub page.

The element requires both the starting and ending tags to be present, and it must be a button element that serves as the first child of a select element. It mirrors content from the selected option element using the cloneNode() method while maintaining the global attributes and event capabilities of standard HTML elements. Its technical properties include content categories of none, permitted content mirroring the selected option, and a mandatory requirement for both tags within the button element structure.

This unique construction handles the styling limitations of the traditional `<option>` tag, which behaves as a "replaced element" OS-dependent and cannot be fully controlled with CSS beyond basic properties like background-color and color. The `<selectedcontent>` element enables developers to include icons, images, and other interactive elements within dropdown menus while maintaining consistent form behavior. For complex styling requirements, developers can utilize the appearance property to remove system-specific styling, though full customization may require alternative approaches such as replacing the select element with custom HTML structures and implementing select functionality through JavaScript.
