# Understanding rel=noopener: A Comprehensive Guide

In today's web landscape, where phishing scams and reverse tabnapping attacks are on the rise, even the tiniest HTML attribute can make or break a website's security. The rel="noopener" attribute, often overlooked in the rush to modern web development practices, quietly protects millions of users from having their browser tabs hijacked by malicious scripts. From preventing login theft to blocking malware downloads, this seemingly simple bit of code has evolved into a crucial frontline defense in our ongoing battle against modern security threats. This guide walks you through the technical details of rel="noopener", explores its impact on security and privacy, and shows you how to implement it for maximum protection in your web projects.


## Background and Technical Explanation

The rel="noopener" attribute instructs the browser to navigate to the target resource without granting access to the current browsing document. This is achieved by not setting the Window.opener property on the opened window, which returns null. When rel="noopener" is used, nonempty target names other than _top, _self, and _parent are treated like _blank in terms of window opening behavior.

The attribute specifies that any browsing context created by following the hyperlink must not have an opener browsing context. This means the new browsing context (tab or window) is isolated from the originating document, preventing the new tab from accessing and manipulating the original tab through the window object.

When used with the target="_blank" attribute, rel="noopener" prevents third-party websites from taking control of the browser tab through the window.opener property. This is particularly important for security, as it protects websites and users from potential harmful actions by other sites. Modern browsers automatically process links with target="_blank" as if rel="noopener" is set, nullifying the need for developers to add it explicitly in many cases.

The attribute works by setting null on the Window.opener property of the external site's window while still allowing the Referer HTTP header to be sent, unless the noreferrer value is also used to remove the Referer header and any information related to the referring website or origin. This simple HTML attribute significantly boosts security for websites, especially when linking to external sites that may lack strong security measures.


## Security Vulnerabilities Addressed by rel=noopener

The attribute prevents reverse tabnapping attacks, where attackers exploit new tab functionality to redirect referring pages to harmful websites, often through phishing scams targeting login information or malware downloads. These attacks rely on the window.opener property, which maintains a JavaScript connection between the new tab and the original page, allowing the attacker to take control of the browsing context.


### How rel=noopener Prevents Security Exploits

When rel=noopener is applied, the browser's window.opener property is explicitly set to null, severing the direct JavaScript connection between the new tab and the original window. This prevents attackers from executing JavaScript within the new tab that could manipulate or control the original tab. The attribute works by breaking the reference chain between tabs, making it impossible for the new tab to access the original window's content or properties.


### Impact on Phishing and Malware Attacks

This separation of browsing contexts is particularly effective against phishing attacks. In a typical phishing scenario, an attacker might open a malicious website in a new tab, which could then use JavaScript to modify the original tab's content or steal user credentials. By preventing the new tab from accessing the original tab's window object, rel=noopener blocks these malicious actions. The attribute maintains the intent of allowing users to open new tabs while significantly reducing the risk of their website being compromised or manipulated through third-party links.


## How rel=noopener Works

The HTML `rel` attribute defines relationships between linked resources and documents. It applies to `<a>`, `<link>`, `<form>`, and `<area>` elements, accepting multiple values combined with spaces. The `noopener` value instructs the browser to navigate to the target resource without granting access to the current browsing document. This is accomplished by setting the `Window.opener` property to null, specifically for external website links.

This attribute is particularly important for security, preventing potential browser hijacking through rogue JavaScript. For example, malicious websites often exploit hyperlinked pages set to open in new tabs, using this feature to redirect referring pages to harmful websites. This is especially dangerous for sites with suspicious designs or services, where attackers can launch phishing scams targeting login information or malware downloads.

Major browsers automatically process links with `target="_blank"` as if `rel="noopener"` is present, nullifying this issue for up-to-date versions. However, website owners must still consider proper implementation when manually handling external links. For WordPress users, the platform automatically adds `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links opening in new tabs since 2017. Other content management systems require manual addition of both `noopener` and `noreferrer` tags for maximum security and privacy protection.


## Best Practices for Using rel=noopener

WordPress automatically adds both rel="noopener" and rel="noreferrer" to external links opening in new tabs since 2017, providing comprehensive security protection without manual intervention for site owners. However, for other content management systems, implementing these attributes requires direct code modification.

The rel="noopener" attribute prevents third-party websites from hijacking browser tabs through the window.opener property, specifically addressing reverse tabnapping vulnerabilities where attackers can redirect referring pages to harmful sites. This is particularly crucial when linking to external sites that may lack robust security measures.

When implemented correctly, these attributes enhance user security by maintaining privacy while preventing external links from controlling or manipulating the original browsing context. The combination of both attributes offers the most comprehensive protection, though WordPress's automated implementation for external links since 2017 ensures that most sites benefit from the security improvements without requiring additional configuration.

The attributes work by explicitly setting the window.opener property to null when opening new tabs, effectively breaking the connection between tabs while maintaining essential functionality for legitimate link usage. This simple HTML modification has no negative impact on search engine optimization, though the noreferrer component may affect referral tracking in analytics tools for websites that rely heavily on tracking external traffic sources.


## Impact on User Experience and SEO

The impact of rel=noopener on user experience and SEO is generally minimal, though certain considerations are important for website owners and developers.


### User Experience Considerations

The removal of rel=noopener from external links can negatively affect user experience and website functionality. This is especially true for WordPress users who may inadvertently disable the attribute through Developer Tools, leaving sites vulnerable to security exploits. The attribute should not be removed for trusted websites or internal links, as it provides essential protection against potential browser hijacking.


### SEO Implications

The rel=noopener attribute has no negative impact on search engine optimization. This is supported by multiple sources, including official documentation from Google and comprehensive testing by website security experts. The attribute's primary function is to enhance website security and protect users from potential exploits, rather than affecting search rankings.


### Privacy and Referral Tracking

The rel=noreferrer component of the attribute can affect referral tracking in analytics tools, particularly for websites that rely heavily on tracking external traffic sources. This aspect should be considered when implementing the attribute across a website's content management system. For WordPress users, the platform's built-in implementation of both attributes since 2017 ensures comprehensive protection without requiring additional configuration.

The attribute's impact on search engine crawlers is minimal, maintaining their ability to follow links and transfer link juice. However, websites should monitor their analytics to ensure the noreferrer component does not significantly affect tracking metrics.
