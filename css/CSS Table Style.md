# CSS Table Styling Techniques

This article explores advanced CSS techniques for styling HTML tables, covering everything from basic structure to responsive design. The primary focus is on creating clean, accessible tables with consistent styling across various screen sizes while maintaining semantic HTML structure. Key topics include table width management, border styling, zebra striping, and responsive layout techniques. Through detailed code examples, the article demonstrates best practices for creating visually appealing and functional tables that work well on both desktop and mobile devices.


## Table Basics: Width and Borders

The table's width is set to 50% of its parent container using the `width: 100%` declaration, with the table itself displaying grid lines through its `display: table` style. The cell boundaries are created with collapsed borders using the `border-collapse: collapse` property, while individual cells receive a 1px solid black border through the `border: 1px solid black` style applied to both `th` and `td` elements.

To achieve a clean grid appearance, the original cell borders overlap, and the collapsing borders property causes adjacent cells to merge their borders into single lines. This effect is achieved by setting the table's border-collapse property to collapse and applying a 1px solid black border to both header and cell elements. The resulting table structure provides a consistent grid without the visual confusion of separate cell borders.

The table width is determined primarily by its parent container, scaling to fill that container while maintaining responsive design through percentage-based dimensions. The widths of the first cell in each column establish the width for all cells in that column due to the `width: 25%` rule applied to `thead th` elements. This approach ensures equal column widths across the table.


## Styling Headers and Cells

The text establishes a consistent center alignment for both header and cell content through the `text-align: center` property applied to all table elements. This default alignment ensures that text remains properly centered regardless of font size or content length.

Header cells maintain their centered alignment through the default behavior of the table's CSS styling, without requiring additional declarations. This centered alignment is particularly important for accessibility, as it ensures that the most crucial table information remains prominent and easy to locate for all users.

The default letter-spacing applies to all cells, with the heading text receiving an additional 2% letter-spacing for enhanced readability. This subtle typographic adjustment helps distinguish the header row while maintaining a clean, organized appearance throughout the table. The text notes that these styles provide visual distinction for the top header row while maintaining accessibility for non-sighted users through proper HTML structure.

The default text alignment remains unchanged throughout these styling changes, allowing for consistent horizontal placement of all table content. This alignment setting ensures that text appears naturally within its cell boundaries without unnecessary adjustments, maintaining the overall readability and structure of the table.


## Zebra Stripes and Backgrounds

The table's row styling employs a combination of alternating background patterns and color schemes to create visual distinction between data rows and header cells. For the main table body, odd-numbered rows display a white background, while even-numbered rows feature a light gray tone (#ddd). This effect is achieved through the `tbody tr:nth-child(odd)` and `tbody tr:nth-child(even)` selectors, applying the respective background colors to every other row.

The header cells receive a more distinctive appearance with a deep blue background and white text. This styling applies specifically to the leftmost column headers, with even rows featuring a slightly darker shade through the `tbody tr:nth-child(even) th` selector. The header cells themselves maintain the standard center alignment established for other table cells, while the text employs a bold weight to differentiate it from the main data rows.

To extend the alternating row colors to header rows, a more complex selector is utilized: `thead tr:nth-child(even) th`. This approach ensures that only even-numbered header rows receive the darker blue background, maintaining visual consistency between the top-level headers and data below. The resulting row coloring creates a clean, zebra-striped pattern that improves readability while preserving the structural clarity of the table's content.


## Border Styling

The table border styling follows a two-tier approach. For the table itself, a 1.5px solid blue border is applied using the shorthand border property: `border: 
1.5px solid blue;`. This style is then extended to all table cells (th, td) with the rule: `th, td { border: 1px solid; }`

The table container employs a 100% width with an additional 20px margin centered using auto positioning: `table { width: 100%; margin: 20px auto; }`. The border-collapse property is set to collapse to merge adjacent cell borders into single lines: `table.one { border-collapse: collapse; }`.

The full-width table structure incorporates padding through the `padding: 8px;` declaration on th, td elements. This padding applies space between the border and content, affecting the table's visual appearance without altering the box model.

For more complex border management, the text introduces separate border properties using the `:is(td, th)` grouping selector. This allows targeted border styles while maintaining table consistency: `:is(td, th) { border-block-width: 1px 0; border-inline-width: 1px 0; &:last-of-type { border-inline-end-width: 1px } }`.

The guide also presents alternative border spacing approaches. The first method uses `border-spacing: 0;` on the table element, while the second method applies `border-inline-width: 1px;` to table cells: `table { border-spacing: 2ch 0; & :is(td, th) { border-inline-width: 1px; } }`. The text notes that achieving rounded corners requires separate border properties due to the border-collapse limitation.

The guide further elaborates on responsive design considerations. To maintain structure on narrow screens, the table employs dynamic column widths with auto layout: `table { table-layout: auto; }`. For fixed-width columns, the fixed layout is used instead: `table { table-layout: fixed; }`. These layout options ensure tables display correctly across various devices and screen sizes.


## Responsive Design

The table structure employs dynamic column widths using the auto layout property: `table { table-layout: auto; }`. This approach allows columns to adjust their widths based on content size, maintaining a flexible design that scales with the parent container. For situations requiring fixed column widths, the text recommends using the fixed layout property: `table { table-layout: fixed; }`. This fixed layout setting ensures consistent column sizing while ignoring content size, providing greater control over table appearance.

On smaller screens, the table resizes column widths through percentage-based dimensions: `thead th { width: 25%; }`. This percentage-based sizing keeps cells responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes. The text notes that only the first cell in each column needs to define its width, as this setting determines the width for all cells in that column.

To maintain structure on narrow screens, the guide recommends using the display properties with appropriate media queries. For example, the text provides the following guidance: `@media screen and (max-width: 600px) { table { table-layout: fixed; } }`. This approach uses fixed layout for smaller screens while maintaining auto layout for larger displays.

The table design incorporates padding through the `padding: 8px;` declaration on th, td elements: `th, td { padding: 8px; }`. This padding applies consistent spacing between the border and content, affecting the table's visual appearance without altering the box model. The text notes that this padding adjustment helps maintain readability and structure across different screen sizes.
