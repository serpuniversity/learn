# JavaScript Proxy:(handler).apply()

JavaScript's Proxy object enables developers to intercept and control how objects are accessed and manipulated, offering powerful capabilities for object virtualization and dynamic behavior modification. This article explores the core concepts of Proxy, with a focus on the (handler).apply() trap, which specifically handles function calls through proxies. We'll examine how Proxy works, its limitations, and advanced techniques for implementing complex patterns while maintaining JavaScript's standard semantics and object integrity.


## Proxy basics and handler structure

The Proxy object creates a handler that can intercept various operations on an underlying target object. This virtualization allows for a wide range of custom behaviors, from simply forwarding operations to modifying how properties are accessed and functions are called.

At its core, a proxy wraps another object (the target) and defines a handler object that controls how operations are performed on that target. The target can be any JavaScript value, including objects, functions, and even regular values. The handler object contains methods known as traps, each corresponding to a specific operation that can be intercepted.

When creating a proxy, you specify the target object and a handler object. The handler can be an empty object, allowing the proxy to behave exactly like the target, or it can contain custom trap functions to redefine specific behaviors. For example, the handler might contain a get() trap to modify how properties are accessed, or an apply() trap to customize how functions are called.

The handler methods have the same names as the internal object operations they trap. These traps can redefine property accessors, as demonstrated in the MDN example where all property accessors are redefined to return "world" instead of the original values. This flexibility allows developers to implement features like computed properties, data validation, and method wrapping without modifying the underlying object's structure.

A key aspect of proxy implementation is how operations are forwarded. Without a specific trap defined in the handler, operations are transparently delegated to the target object. This allows proxies to act as a bridge between the real object and the virtual behavior defined in the handler, maintaining the appearance of a standard JavaScript object while enabling sophisticated runtime modifications.


## The apply trap and function interception

The `apply` trap specifically captures function calls through a proxy, allowing developers to intercept and manipulate these calls while maintaining the function's callable nature. This trap operates within the broader Proxy framework, which enables interception of various object operations through trap functions.

However, the `apply` trap has inherent limitations. It can only process function calls and requires the target object to have a [[Call]] internal method for the Proxy to function correctly. This limitation was observed in projects where developers needed to manipulate objects passed from Worker processes. To address this, developers created wrapper functions that redirected calls to the Proxy object, effectively making non-callable objects appear as functions to the Proxy mechanism.

The fundamental restriction on the `apply` trap stems from the internal implementation requirements of JavaScript engines. The `Proxy` mechanism maintains the equivalence between `typeof x === "function"` and `x is callable`, as specified in the ECMAScript standard. This equivalence dictates that a Proxy must have a [[Call]] internal method if and only if its target has one, enforcing the trap's function-specific behavior.

This limitation impacts various Proxy use cases, particularly those involving objects with custom callable behavior. Developers working around these restrictions often implement wrapper functions that convert non-callable objects into a callable form acceptable to the Proxy mechanism. This workaround enables more flexible interception while maintaining compatibility with existing JavaScript semantics.


## Proxy implementation examples

The Proxy API provides a powerful mechanism for customizing object behavior through trap functions. Commonly used traps include:

- **Get Method**: Similar to Reflect.get(), this trap allows intercepting property access. It can be used to implement computed properties where values are dynamically determined based on other properties.

- **Set Method**: This trap controls property assignment, enabling validation logic before changes are applied. For example, you can enforce constraints such as requiring age values to be positive numbers or preventing the creation of certain properties.

- **Apply Trap**: This specific trap handles function calls through the proxy, allowing for custom behavior while maintaining the function's callable nature. It requires the target object to have a [[Call]] internal method for the proxy to function correctly.

Additional traps provide extensive customization capabilities, including:

- **Construct Trap**: Intercepts `new` operator usage, allowing custom behavior for function instantiation.

- **GetPrototypeOf**: Traps `[[GetPrototypeOf]]` calls, enabling custom prototype handling.

- **SetPrototypeOf**: Manages `Object.setPrototypeOf` calls through the proxy.

- **IsExtensible**: Controls `Object.isExtensible` operations.

- **PreventExtensions**: Implements `Object.preventExtensions` functionality.

- **GetOwnPropertyDescriptor**: Traps `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` calls.

These traps enable building sophisticated behavior layers around objects, including:

- Validation: Enforcing data constraints before property changes

- Logging: Recording access and modification events

- Wrapping: Implementing function decorators or method interception

- Security: Protecting sensitive properties with access control

Practical examples demonstrate the API's versatility. For instance, a proxy can restrict an object to contain only specific properties, similar to React's useRef functionality:

```javascript

const data = {};

const newProxy = new Proxy(data, {

  set: function (target, key, value) {

    if (key === "current") {

      Reflect.set(target, key, value);

      return true;

    }

    return false;

  }

});

newProxy.current = 1; // Valid

newProxy.point = 1;   // Throws error

```

This implementation uses the set trap to enforce rule-based property modification, ensuring that only the "current" property can be updated while preventing the creation of other properties.

The Proxy API works in conjunction with the Reflect API methods, which provide built-in functionality for intercepting JavaScript operations. This combination allows developers to implement complex behaviors while maintaining compatibility with standard JavaScript semantics.


## Performance considerations and limitations

While powerful, the Proxy API has several practical limitations that developers should consider when deciding whether to use this feature. These limitations primarily affect performance, compatibility with built-in objects, and use cases requiring high execution efficiency.

Performance impact is a significant consideration, particularly when working with large datasets or performance-critical applications. Accessing properties through a Proxy typically introduces overhead compared to direct object access. Benchmarks show that a simple property access using a proxy can take several times longer than accessing the same property directly, though exact performance variations depend on the JavaScript engine implementation.

Built-in objects present specific challenges. JavaScript's internal slots—used to store information about built-in objects like arrays and DOM nodes—cannot be directly proxied. This limitation impacts performance-critical sections of code, especially when working with common data structures. For example, attempting to access a DOM node's attributes through a Proxy results in a TypeError, as the internal [[Get]] slot that manages these operations cannot be intercepted.

To address these limitations, developers must carefully consider their use cases. While proxies excel in scenarios requiring dynamic response to changing data or sophisticated object manipulation, they may not be suitable for performance-critical applications. The combination of trap methods and Reflect API provides flexibility, but the underlying overhead makes them less ideal for real-time or high-frequency operations.

For developers implementing complex object validation or creating dynamic data structures, the Proxy API offers substantial benefits. However, they should evaluate performance requirements carefully. In cases where direct object access is sufficient, traditional methods provide better efficiency. For complex applications combining static and dynamic data structures, developers might use proxies for dynamic parts while retaining traditional objects for performance-critical sections.


## Advanced proxy techniques

The Proxy API's flexibility extends to advanced use cases through multiple proxy layers and specialized handler implementations. This enables sophisticated patterns including local-to-remote object remoting, database access object creation, and profiling method invocation tracking.


### Multiple Proxy Layers

The Proxy mechanism allows wrapping an object multiple times with different handler implementations, effectively building layers of functionality. For instance, a simple revocable reference implementation can demonstrate multiple layers:

```javascript

function createRevocableReference(target) {

  let enabled = true;

  const handler = new Proxy(target, {

    get(target, propKey, receiver) {

      if (!enabled) {

        throw new TypeError('Revoked');

      }

      return Reflect.get(target, propKey, receiver);

    },

    has(target, propKey) {

      if (!enabled) {

        throw new TypeError('Revoked');

      }

      return Reflect.has(target, propKey);

    }

  });

  return { reference: new Proxy(target, handler), revoke() { enabled = false; } };

}

// Or, using proxy-as-handler technique for simpler implementation

function createRevocableReference(target) {

  let enabled = true;

  const handler = new Proxy({}, {

    get(dummyTarget, trapName, receiver) {

      if (!enabled) {

        throw new TypeError('Revoked');

      }

      return Reflect[trapName];

    }

  });

  return { reference: new Proxy(target, handler), revoke() { enabled = false; } };

}

// Using ECMAScript 6 capabilities

function createRevocableReference(target) {

  const

}

```

The flexibility here allows for precise control over access while maintaining the object's integrity and functionality.


### Data Access Objects

Another advanced technique is creating data access objects that read and write directly to databases. This pattern combines method implementation with targeted database access through Proxy methods:

```javascript

createDataAccessObject(modelName) {

  const dataModel = new Proxy({}, { get(target, propKey, receiver) {

    return this.readMethod(target, propKey);

  }, set(target, propKey, value, receiver) {

    return this.writeMethod(target, propKey, value);

  } });

  return dataModel;

}

```

This implementation uses the Proxy API to intercept property accesses and writes, routing them to database operations while maintaining local object semantics.


### Web Service Creation

Web services can also be implemented using Proxy, combining method definition with actual HTTP requests:

```javascript

createWebService() {

  const webService = new Proxy({}, {

    get(target, propKey, receiver) {

      return Reflect.get(target, propKey, receiver);

    }

  });

  Object.keys(webService).forEach(methodName => {

    webService[methodName] = function(...args) {

      // Implement HTTP request using XMLHttpRequest or fetch

      const request = new XMLHttpRequest();

      request.open('GET', this.url + '/api/' + methodName);

      request.send();

    }

  });

  return webService;

}

```

This pattern demonstrates how Proxy can encapsulate service functionality while maintaining standard JavaScript method semantics.

These advanced techniques highlight Proxy's flexibility in implementing complex patterns while maintaining JavaScript's standard semantics and object integrity.
