# JavaScript Reference & Tutorial: Errors > Already has pragma

JavaScript has evolved dramatically since its inception, and with that growth has come an increasingly sophisticated ecosystem of tools and best practices. From the humble beginnings of basic client-side scripting to the powerful frameworks and libraries of today, JavaScript developers face a constantly changing landscape of features, standards, and best practices. This article navigates through one specific aspect of JavaScript development - the handling of source maps and pragma directives - to demonstrate how the language continues to evolve to meet modern development challenges.


## Source Map Pragma Deprecation

The "@" syntax for source map pragmas has been officially deprecated in favor of "#" since the source map specification's evolution to address compatibility issues with Internet Explorer's conditional compilation comment. This change corrects an error in the original pragma implementation that affected libraries like jQuery and other JavaScript tools. Modern JavaScript development tools now recognize the newer "#" syntax for sourceMappingURL assignments, as demonstrated in valid source map comments like:

```javascript

//# sourceMappingURL=http://example.com/path/to/your/sourcemap.map

```

Source maps enable developers to debug minified JavaScript code by mapping execution back to the original source files. While the syntax change does not affect JavaScript execution, it's essential for maintaining compatibility with both development tools and runtime environments that adhere to the updated source map specification.

Developers encountering the "Using //@ to indicate sourceURL pragmas is deprecated. Use //# instead" warning can resolve the issue by updating their sourceMappingURL comments to use the new "#" syntax. For combined and minified code, developers should ensure source maps are assigned only once via either a comment in the file or an HTTP header, as multiple sourceMappingURL assignments will trigger warnings about files already having a sourceMappingURL attribute.


## JavaScript Reference Errors

Reference errors occur when JavaScript tries to access a variable that doesn't exist, hasn't been defined, or doesn't exist in the current scope from which you are trying to access it. These errors happen when you create or declare a variable, which creates a reference to an object with an associated value. For example, `const a = "Apple"` tells the JavaScript compiler that whenever it sees the variable `a`, it should interpret it as its value - meaning, it should see `a` as the string with the value of Apple. The error occurs when JavaScript encounters a variable that doesn't have a declaration, making it a silent error in default mode but requiring strict mode to catch these errors, throwing ReferenceErrors. This means that undeclared variables result in silent errors in default mode but strict mode catches these errors, throwing ReferenceErrors.


### Common Causes of Reference Errors

The most common cause of reference errors is forgetting to define variables before referencing them, commenting out declared variables that are still in use, or using variables in scopes they are not intended to be accessed. Other common causes include trying to access let or const variables before their declaration, which results in ReferenceErrors. Therefore, the solution is to declare the variable first.


### Scope Considerations

JavaScript has different scope rules for function-scoped variables, which are only accessible within their function, and block-scoped variables using let and const, which are only accessible within their block. Var is globally scoped outside functions and function-scoped inside functions. This means that while you can access function-scoped variables outside their function in "use strict" mode, you cannot access let or const variables outside their block.


### Best Practices for Prevention

Several strategies can prevent reference errors. Code editors with syntax highlighting can help catch undeclared variables. Tools like ESLint can detect specific patterns that might cause these errors. TypeScript provides compile-time error detection, and static analysis in Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines can catch issues before deployment. Additionally, using extensions for IntelliSense/code completion and enabling strict mode in JavaScript can help prevent these errors.


### JavaScript Pragma Usage

The article covers JavaScript pragmas, including the "use strict" directive, which enables strict mode execution. In strict mode, the following features are affected: bad syntax is not allowed, hoisting is disabled, silent errors are shown, and additional security and optimization features are implemented. While the "use strict" directive is now widely used, it's important to note that the original draft spec for JavaScript 2.0 from April 2002 mentioned pragmas in general, but none of those specific pragmas have been widely recognized since then.


## Pragma Directives in JavaScript

JavaScript pragmas are compiler directives that provide additional information about how to interpret the code. The two pragmas introduced in JavaScript are "use strict" and "strict".

The "use strict" pragma, when placed at the top of a JavaScript file or function, enables strict mode execution. This mode enforces stricter syntax and runtime behavior, such as disallowing certain operations and providing additional security features. For example, strict mode prevents silent errors by requiring all variables to be declared, disables hoisting, and implements additional security and optimization features.

The "use strict" directive can be placed at the file or function level. When placed at the file level, it applies to the entire file. When placed at the function level, it applies only to the function's scope. This allows developers to selectively enable strict mode within specific function implementations while keeping the rest of the file in non-strict mode.

Additional JavaScript pragmas include:

- ecmascript(n): Error if version n of ECMAScript is not supported; otherwise recommends but does not require that the implementation only support ECMAScript version n features.

- javascript(n): Error if version n of JavaScript is not supported; otherwise recommends but does not require that the implementation only support JavaScript version n features.

- wrap: Controls integer conversion behavior

- wrap(true): Causes an error when converting an out-of-range integer to an integral machine type

- wrap(false): Enables wrapping behavior for out-of-range integers (default)

Pragma effect is lexically scoped, meaning it applies from the directive after the pragma until the end of the enclosing block, directive group, or substatement group. Multiple pragmas with the same identifier are evaluated in last-overrides-first order. If an unrecognized pragma identifier is encountered, pragmas ending with "?" are ignored, while others cause an error.

While the "use strict" pragma has become widely adopted, its implementation sacrifices some compatibility with JavaScript 1.5 for enhanced features and error checking. Modern JavaScript development tools and environments expect this directive, and its absence can lead to unexpected behavior and reduced code quality.


## Source Map Handling

Source maps enable developers to debug minified JavaScript code by mapping execution back to the original source files. When a JavaScript file is being assigned a sourceMappingURL comment, but already has one, a warning is generated: "file is being assigned a sourceMappingURL, but already has one." This warning occurs when a source map has been specified more than once for a given JavaScript source, which is common in combined and minified code delivery methods.

Source maps can be assigned in two ways: through a comment in the file (e.g., js #sourceMap=http://example.com/path/to/your/sourcemap.map) or by setting a header in the JavaScript file (e.g., http X-SourceMap: /path/to/file.js.map). When a source map is specified more than once in a JavaScript file, the warning indicates that JavaScript execution will not be halted. This duplication of sourceMappingURL assignments can occur during the minification process when multiple source maps are incorrectly applied to the same file.

The warning stems from the source map specification's evolution to address compatibility issues with Internet Explorer's conditional compilation comment. The original implementation of the sourceMappingURL comment syntax caused conflicts with jQuery and other JavaScript libraries, leading to the specification's change to use the newer "#" syntax for sourceMappingURL assignments.

Developers can prevent this warning by ensuring source maps are assigned only once via either a comment in the file or an HTTP header, rather than including multiple sourceMappingURL assignments. This practice maintains compatibility with development tools and runtime environments that adhere to the updated source map specification while avoiding unnecessary warnings about files already having a sourceMappingURL attribute.
