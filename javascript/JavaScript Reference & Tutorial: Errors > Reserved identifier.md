# JavaScript Reserved Identifier Errors

JavaScript's syntax continually evolves, adding new features while maintaining existing functionality. This progression introduces reserved words that hold specific syntactic roles. While most reserved words cannot be used as identifiers, understanding their rules is crucial for writing clean, future-proof code. This article explores JavaScript's reserved words, explaining why certain keywords are off-limits and how to safely use some in property names. We'll also examine common errors and best practices to help developers write robust JavaScript applications.


## Reserved Words Overview

In JavaScript, reserved words are certain keywords that cannot be used as identifiers, including variable names, function names, or property names. These keywords have specific syntactic roles and cannot be used for regular identifiers. For example, "if" cannot be used as a variable name because it is a reserved keyword used to start an if statement.

Reserved words fall into distinct categories based on their behavior. Core keywords like "break," "case," "continue," and "default" are entirely reserved and cannot be used anywhere as identifiers. Contextually reserved keywords like "await," "lete, and "yield" have more restrictive usage rules. For example, "let" can be used as an identifier in non-strict mode, but "await" can only appear in async function bodies.

While most reserved words cannot be used as identifiers, JavaScript makes exceptions for a few keywords to maintain backward compatibility. This includes "let" and "yield," which were introduced in ECMAScript 2015. These keywords can technically be used as identifiers without causing SyntaxError, but using them as such is not recommended.

Property names present a slightly different case. As noted by the JavaScript specification, property names must be IdentifierName, not Identifier, allowing reserved words to function as property names with proper context. For example, "class" can safely be used as a property name when quoted: `var obj = { "class": "is perfectly fine" }; console.log(obj["class"]);`

Developers should avoid using reserved words as identifiers whenever possible to prevent SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word errors. However, understanding these rules helps identify when reserved words can be safely used in property names, ensuring both modern and legacy JavaScript code works correctly.


## Reserved Keyword Restrictions

The 15 core keywords (break, case, catch, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, else, export, extends, finally, for) and function-related keywords (function, if, import, in, instanceOf, new, return, super, switch, this, throw, try, typeof, var, void, while, with, yield) cannot be used as identifiers in any context. These keywords serve specific syntactic roles and attempting to use them as variable names, function names, or property names will result in a SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word.

Another 14 keywords (await, let, static, yield) have more limited contexts where they can be used as identifiers. For example, let can be used as a variable name in non-strict mode or when declared with var outside of class declarations, but not inside class declarations or with const. The context-sensitive keywords restrict development best practices while maintaining compatibility with existing JavaScript codebases.

While most reserved words cannot be used as identifiers, JavaScript makes exceptions for a few keywords to maintain compatibility with older code. This includes let and yield, which can technically be used as identifiers without causing SyntaxError but are strongly discouraged in most cases. Let can be used as a variable name if declared with var outside of class declarations, while yield can be used in specific contexts like generator function bodies.

Property names present a slightly different case, as they must be IdentifierName rather than Identifier. This allows reserved words to function as property names with proper context. For example, class can safely be used as a property name when quoted: `var obj = { "class": "is perfectly fine" }; console.log(obj["class"]);` This capability enables developers to use reserved words as property names while avoiding syntax errors, as long as the keywords are properly quoted.


## Identifier Best Practices

When working with JavaScript identifiers, developers should follow these best practices to avoid reserved word errors:


### Variable and Function Names

- Avoid using core keywords like break, case, catch, class, and for as variable names. For example, the following code will cause a SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word:

```javascript

var case = "example";

console.log(case);  // Raises SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word

```

- While let and yield can be used as variable names in specific contexts, it's recommended to avoid them when possible to maintain code clarity. For instance, let can be used as a variable name if declared with var outside of class declarations:

```javascript

var let = "example";

console.log(let);  // No error, outputs "example"

```

- Future reserved keywords like enum, implements, and interface should not be used as variable names unless explicitly declared in strict mode or specific contexts.


### Class Declarations

- Do not use class, implements, interface, or yield as class names. This will result in a SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word. For example:

```javascript

class class { constructor() { console.log("class constructor"); } }

new class();  // Raises SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word

```

- Use specific naming conventions to avoid reserved words. For instance, when working with Mootools element constructors or jQueryUI Dialog, consider using alternative names like klazz or Class.


### Property Names

- While property names can be reserved words, use quotes to safely include them in object literals. For example, class can be used as a property name when quoted:

```javascript

var obj = { "class": "is perfectly fine" };

console.log(obj["class"]);

```

- The leading underscore convention can help indicate private properties: 

```javascript

var obj = { _privateProp: "hidden value" };

console.log(obj._privateProp);  // No error, outputs "hidden value"

```


### Contextual Usage

- be mindful of future reserved words that may become fully reserved in strict mode or specific contexts. For example, implements and public are only reserved in specific contexts (class declarations or module code) and should be used with appropriate caution.

- When working with ECMA-262 3-5 edition differences, ensure dot notation access maintains valid syntax for reserved words as property accessors.


## Error Handling

The "variable is a reserved identifier" error occurs when reserved keywords are used as identifiers. The error message varies across browsers: Edge displays "SyntaxError: The use of a future reserved word for an identifier is invalid," Firefox shows "SyntaxError: "x" is a reserved identifier," and Chrome reports "SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word."

In strict mode, the following keywords become fully reserved: implements, package, public, interface, private, protected, let, static. The enum keyword is reserved in both strict and sloppy modes. Using reserved keywords as identifiers will throw a SyntaxError.

Common causes of this error include:

1. Incorrect class declaration syntax, as demonstrated in the following example:

```javascript

class { constructor() { this.name = "Example"; } }

```

This results in a SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word. The correct syntax requires class declaration with a proper name:

```javascript

class Example {

  constructor() {

    this.name = "Example";

  }

}

let obj = new Example();

console.log(obj.name);

```

2. Unquoted property names that conflict with reserved keywords, as in:

```javascript

var obj = { class: "is perfectly fine" };

```

Using the reserved word "class" as an unquoted property name throws a SyntaxError in strict mode. However, when properly quoted:

```javascript

var obj = { "class": "is perfectly fine" };

console.log(obj["class"]);

```

The code works without error, demonstrating the importance of context in identifier usage.

When developing in JavaScript, it's crucial to adhere to reserved keyword usage rules to prevent SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word errors. Proper coding practices, such as using quoted property names and avoiding reserved keywords as identifiers, ensure robust and maintainable code.


## Future Reservations

Future reserved keywords include enum, implements, interface, let, package, private, protected, public, static, and yield. These keywords have specific contexts where they can be used as identifiers, but are reserved for future language features.

In strict mode and async function bodies, the following keywords become fully reserved: implements, interface, private, protected, static, and yield. These keywords will cause SyntaxError if used as identifiers in these contexts.

Module code restricts await, which can only appear in async function bodies. Static is reserved only in class declarations, while let is reserved only in strict mode code or const/let/class declarations.

Understanding these restrictions helps developers work within JavaScript's evolving syntax rules. For instance, consider the following correctly implemented async function:

```javascript

async function getResults() {

  let results = await fetch('api/data');

  return results.json();

}

```

This demonstrates proper use of the reserved keyword await in its limited context. Similarly, static members require correct class declaration syntax:

```javascript

class MyClass {

  static myMethod() {

    console.log("Static method called");

  }

}

MyClass.myMethod();  // Correct usage of static keyword

```

These examples illustrate how future reserved keywords integrate into JavaScript's syntax while maintaining backward compatibility through specific context requirements.
