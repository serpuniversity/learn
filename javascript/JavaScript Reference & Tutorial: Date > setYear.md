# JavaScript Date setYear() Method

JavaScript's Date object provides a suite of methods for working with dates and times, but the `setYear()` method stands out as a unique case in this landscape. Unlike its counterpart `setFullYear()`, which has become the standard for manipulating year values, `setYear()` presents some intriguing (and potentially confusing) behaviors that developers need to understand. This article explores the nuances of `setYear()`, from its basic functionality to its quirks with two-digit years and date manipulation. We'll examine how this method interprets different input values, demonstrates its usage through practical examples, and discusses its compatibility across various browsers. Most importantly, we'll highlight why developers today should be using `setFullYear()` instead, while still acknowledging the historical significance and occasional usefulness of `setYear()`.


## Overview of Date.setYear()

The Date.setYear() method sets the year for a specified date according to universal time. It accepts an integer value representing the year and returns the number of milliseconds between the updated date and January 1, 1970.

The method behaves differently based on the input value:

- For two-digit numbers, it interprets any two-digit number as an offset to 1900. For example, new Date(61) sets the year to 1961, and new Date("2/1/22") sets the year to 2022.

- For integers greater than or equal to 100, it treats the value as a year directly (e.g., new Date(1995) creates the year 1995).

- For values less than 100, it adds 1900 to the input (e.g., new Date(61) results in the year 1961).

When used with a date object, setting the year affects the entire date object:

```javascript

var dt = new Date("Aug 28, 2008 13:30:00");

dt.setYear(2000);

console.log(dt); // Output: Mon Aug 28 2000 13:30:00 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)

```

The method's behavior with month and day values allows for flexible date adjustments:

- Setting a month to 15 increments the year (e.g., January 15 becomes February of the next year)

- Setting day to 32 advances to the first day of the following month (if 31 days)

- Setting day to -1 sets the date to the previous month's last day

While effective for many date manipulations, the method has several limitations:

- It does not handle leap years and time zones consistently

- Two-digit year values are treated as offsets to 1900, which can lead to unexpected results

- The method has been deprecated in some newer browsers and is no longer recommended for new development

For more reliable date operations, modern JavaScript developers should prefer the setFullYear() method, which handles year values directly and is supported across all modern browsers.


## Syntax and Parameters

The setYear() method takes a single parameter: yearValue (an integer representing the year to set). The method returns the number of milliseconds between the new updated date and 1 January 1970.

The implementation behaves differently based on the input value:

- For two-digit numbers, the method interprets any two-digit number as an offset to 1900. For example, new Date(61) results in the year value being set to 1961, and new Date("2/1/22") results in the year value being set to 2022.

- For integers between 0 and 99, the year is set to 1900 + yearValue.

- For integers 100 or greater, the method treats the value as a year directly (e.g., new Date(1995) creates the year 1995).

- If the input value is NaN or other values that get coerced to NaN, the date is set to Invalid Date and NaN is returned.

The method modifies the date object in place and has the following syntax:

```javascript

date.setYear(yearValue)

```

where yearValue is the integer value representing the year to set.


## Example Usage

The example demonstrates setting the year to 2000 for a date object initialized with "Aug 28, 2008 13:30:00". The output shows the date as Monday, August 28, 2000, 13:30:00 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time). The method modifies the date object in place and returns the number of milliseconds between the new updated date and 1 January 1970.

The implementation handles the year value as follows:

- For two-digit numbers, the method interprets any two-digit number as an offset to 1900. For example, new Date(61) results in the year value being set to 1961, and new Date("2/1/22") results in the year value being set to 2022.

- For integers between 0 and 99, the year is set to 1900 + yearValue.

- For integers 100 or greater, the method treats the value as a year directly (e.g., new Date(1995) creates the year 1995).

The method returns NaN for invalid inputs and sets the date to Invalid Date in such cases. It modifies the date object in place and has the following syntax: date.setYear(yearValue). The method has been widely available since July 2015 and is compatible across many devices and browser versions, though it has been deprecated in some newer browsers and is no longer recommended for new development.


## Browser Compatibility

Browser compatibility for JavaScript's Date methods has evolved significantly since the initial release. According to the official MDN documentation, the `setYear` and `setFullYear` methods provide basic support across multiple devices and browser versions. These methods have been widely available since July 2015, with implementation across Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari.

Detailed exploration of browser compatibility reveals some specific behaviors. For instance, Internet Explorer 8 lacks support for the ISO8601 Date Format. More recent developments in ECMAScript specifications (1st Edition, ECMAScript 5.1, and Release Candidate) have refined these methods, though broader compatibility improvements continue to emerge.

The legacy nature of these methods becomes particularly evident when considering their interactions with local system settings. While modern JavaScript development generally recommends using `setFullYear` for direct year manipulation, understanding how these methods interact with local time zones and system clocks remains crucial for development best practices. developers are encouraged to consult official documentation and testing across supported platforms to ensure reliable date operations.


## Important Notes

The setYear() method's handling of two-digit years as offsets to 1900 can lead to unexpected results. For precise date calculations, developers should avoid this method and use setFullYear() or construct dates explicitly with new Date(year, month, day).

The method's interaction with day and month values requires careful consideration. Setting a month to 15 advances to the following year, while setting day to 32 advances to the first day of the subsequent month. These behaviors differ slightly from the more intuitive 13-month and 31-day limits, making explicit date calculations more reliable.

When working across time zones, the method's behavior can vary between different environments. Internet Explorer 8 lacks support for ISO8601 Date Format, which can affect how date calculations and string representations are handled. Modern JavaScript development should prioritize using built-in methods like setFullYear() to ensure consistent and accurate date operations across all supported browsers and environments.
