# JavaScript Array toSpliced: Method and Usage

The JavaScript toSpliced() method offers a powerful approach to array manipulation by creating dense arrays through efficient property reading and writing. Released as part of ECMAScript 2026, this feature brings enhanced capabilities for both array-like and traditional arrays, with support across modern browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera. Unlike its predecessor, the splice method, toSpliced consistently returns a new array while leaving the original unchanged, making it an invaluable tool for scenarios requiring immutable data structures or maintaining array integrity. This article explores the method's implementation, provides detailed usage examples, and offers best practices for developers working with JavaScript arrays in the modern web ecosystem.


## Introduction to toSpliced

The toSpliced() method creates a dense array by reading the length property and writing needed properties into a new array, similar to the Array.prototype.splice.apply() approach. This method works on both array-like objects and arrays, returning a dense array without modifying the original.

The method's implementation is part of the ECMAScript 2026 Language Specification, with browser support beginning in Chrome 110, Edge 110, Firefox 115, Safari 16.4, and Opera 96. It creates a new array by reading the length property and writing needed properties from the original array into the new array.

For example, consider the following array:

```javascript

const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const newArray = originalArray.toSpliced(2, 0, 'a', 'b');

console.log(newArray); // [1, 2, 'a', 'b', 4, 5]

console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```

In this case, toSpliced() is called with a start index of 2, a delete count of 0, and two new elements 'a' and 'b'. The method creates a new array with the specified modifications while leaving the original array unchanged.


## toSpliced Method Syntax and Parameters

The toSpliced() method syntax allows for multiple variations in calling parameters:

```javascript

toSpliced(start)

toSpliced(start, deleteCount)

toSpliced(start, deleteCount, item1)

toSpliced(start, deleteCount, item1, item2)

toSpliced(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, /* ... */ itemN)

```

The method requires the start parameter, which specifies the zero-based index at which to begin modifying the array. This parameter is converted to an integer, and negative values count back from the end of the array. When the start index is more negative than -length of the caller array (-array.length <= start < 0), the start + array.length value is used. If start is less than -array.length or omitted, the method defaults to 0. If start is greater than or equal to array.length, no elements are deleted, and the method behaves as an adding function, inserting as many elements as provided.

The deleteCount parameter is optional and indicates the number of elements to remove from the specified start index. If omitted or deleteCount >= number of elements after the position specified by start, all elements from start to the end of the array are deleted. If deleteCount is 0 or negative, no elements are removed, and the method behaves as an adding function. If deleteCount is Infinity, all elements after start will be deleted.

The method accepts zero or more elements as arguments following the deleteCount parameter. When no elements are specified and deleteCount is 0, toSpliced() performs only deletion operations. Multiple elements can be added at the specified start index using this syntax. The method returns a new array that consists of all elements before start, the provided elements, and all elements after start + deleteCount.

The implementation creates a dense array by reading the length property and writing needed properties from the original array into the new array, producing a new array rather than modifying the original. This approach ensures that elements remain accessible in the original array while providing a clean separation between the modified and unmodified arrays.


## toSpliced vs. splice


#### Method Implementation and Behavior

While both methods modify array contents, toSpliced creates a new array leaving the original unchanged, whereas splice mutates the original array and returns removed elements. This key distinction makes toSpliced particularly valuable when working with immutable data structures or when maintaining the original array's integrity is critical.


##### Original Array Preservation

A fundamental difference between these methods lies in their approach to modifying array contents. When using toSpliced, the original array remains untouched, as demonstrated in the following example:

```javascript

const colors = ['Red', 'Green', 'White', 'Black'];

const updatedColors = colors.toSpliced(1, 0, 'DarkSlateGray', 'Ivory');

console.log(updatedColors); // ['Red', 'DarkSlateGray', 'Ivory', 'White', 'Black']

console.log(colors); // ['Red', 'Green', 'White', 'Black']

```


#### Return Value and Usage Patterns

Whereas toSpliced consistently returns a new array containing the modified elements, splice returns an array of removed items, if any. This behavior makes toSpliced particularly useful in scenarios where both the original and modified arrays are needed. For instance:

```javascript

function adjustArray(arr) {

  return arr.toSpliced(2, 1, 'Yellow', 'Orange');

}

const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date'];

console.log(adjustArray(fruits)); // ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Yellow', 'Orange', 'Date']

console.log(fruits); // ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date']

```


#### Quirks and Considerations

Like its counterpart, toSpliced allows for flexible usage patterns, including adding new elements, removing existing ones, or combining both operations in a single call. This flexibility mirrors the behavior of splice, which also supports multiple calling patterns for different modification needs. Understanding these similarities and differences enables developers to choose the most appropriate method based on their specific requirements for array modification and preservation.


## Implementation and Browser Support

The toSpliced() method is part of the ECMAScript 2026 Language Specification and introduces a new approach to array modification that is distinct from its predecessor, splice. While both methods enable the addition and removal of array elements, toSpliced creates a new array, leaving the original unchanged. This feature makes it particularly useful in scenarios requiring immutable data structures or maintaining the integrity of the original array.

The method's implementation leverages the length property to create a dense array by reading integer-keyed properties from the original array and writing them into the new array structure. This approach ensures efficient memory usage while providing developers with a robust tool for array manipulation. The specification defines toSpliced to work on both array-like objects and traditional arrays, offering broad compatibility across array implementations.

Browser support for the toSpliced method began with modern browsers in July 2023, aligning with the release of ECMAScript 2026. The method is available in Chrome 110, Edge 110, Firefox 115, Safari 16.4, and Opera 96, establishing a solid foundation of support across leading web browsers. This widespread availability enables developers to adopt the feature with confidence, knowing it is widely accessible to their user base.


## Best Practices and Performance Considerations

The JavaScript Array toSpliced method introduces best practices centered around array immutability and efficient data management. Developers should always create a copy of the array before performing mutations to prevent unexpected changes to original data structures. 

The toSpliced method specifically addresses these concerns by returning a new array that contains the modifications while leaving the original array untouched. This design mirrors the functionality of slice, which creates a shallow copy of the array before performing any operations.

To safely manipulate arrays, developers can implement patterns similar to the following example, which demonstrates creating a copy before mutation:

```javascript

function safeModifyArray(arr) {

  const modifiedArray = arr.toSpliced(1, 2, 'a', 'b');

  return modifiedArray;

}

const originalArray = ['x', 'y', 'z'];

const result = safeModifyArray(originalArray);

console.log(result); // ['x', 'a', 'b', 'z']

console.log(originalArray); // ['x', 'y', 'z']

```

This approach ensures that the original array remains unchanged, allowing developers to maintain consistent data integrity across their applications.
