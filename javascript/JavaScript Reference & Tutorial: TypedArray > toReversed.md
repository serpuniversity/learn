# TypedArray toReversed Method

JavaScript's typed arrays provide a powerful way to work with structured binary data, offering both performance advantages and specialized methods for array manipulation. The introduction of TypedArray.prototype.toReversed() in modern JavaScript brings important advances in array handling, particularly for developers working with fixed and typed data structures. This new method creates a reversed copy of a typed array, maintaining the original data while providing essential immutability. Understanding its implementation details and comparing it to existing methods like reverse() highlights how ECMAScript continues to evolve, offering more precise tools for working with typed arrays while preserving the language's growing focus on data immutability.


## Introduction to TypedArray toReversed

The TypedArray.prototype.toReversed() method creates a new typed array with elements arranged in reverse order. This method is specifically designed for typed array instances and operates as a copying counterpart to the reverse() method. While reverse() modifies the original array in place and returns it, toReversed() creates and returns a new array with elements in reversed order.

The method's implementation closely mirrors the algorithm used by Array.prototype.toReversed(), transposing the elements of the input array in reverse order and returning the resulting array. For instance, calling toReversed() on a Uint8Array instance will produce a new array where the original first element becomes the last, and vice versa.

Development of the toReversed() method aligns with broader ECMAScript 2026 Language Specification updates, specifically addressing the need for more predictable array manipulation methods in JavaScript. This new functionality brings enhanced usability for developers working with typed arrays, particularly in scenarios where maintaining array immutability is crucial.


## Implementation Details

The `toReversed` method creates a new typed array of the same type and length as the original, then populates it by iterating from the original array's last element to the first. This reverse-iteration process is implemented by creating a new array and setting each element to the corresponding value from the original array in reverse order.

The method follows a specific algorithm: it determines the original array's length, creates a new array of the same type and length, then iterates from the last index to the first, setting each element of the new array to the corresponding element of the original array in reversed order. This process produces a new array with elements in the reverse of the original array's order, without modifying the original array.

The method's implementation closely mirrors the algorithm used by `Array.prototype.toReversed()`, though with specific handling for typed array types. For example, when implemented on a `Uint8Array`, the method creates a new `Uint8Array` instance with the same length, then populates it by iterating from the original array's last element to the first, ensuring that the new array maintains the same type and structure as the original.


## Comparison with reverse() Method

When compared with the `reverse()` method, `toReversed()` introduces a critical distinction in behavior while maintaining similarities in functionality. While both methods address reversing array elements, `toReversed()` explicitly returns a new array without modifying the original, aligning with JavaScript's growing emphasis on immutable operations (ECMAScript 2023 features).

The method's implementation closely mirrors the algorithm used by `Array.prototype.toReversed()`, transposing elements in reverse order and returning a new array instance. This consistent design choice across both primitive and typed arrays ensures predictable behavior while providing specialized functionality for typed array manipulation.

Modern browser support confirms the method's availability across all major platforms: Chrome 110+, Edge 110+, Firefox 115+, Safari 16+, Opera 96+, and mobile equivalents. The implementation's specification-compliance across devices ensures consistent behavior while maintaining compatibility with older systems through well-supported polyfills and shims.


## Browser and Version Support

The `toReversed()` method supports modern browsers and environments across desktop and mobile platforms. The implementation follows the latest developments in web standards, with official support available in the following versions across major browsers:

- Desktop: Chrome 110+, Edge 110+, Firefox 115+, Safari 16+, Opera 96+

- Mobile: Chrome 110+, Edge 110+, Firefox 115+, Opera 96+, Safari 16+, Chrome Android 110+, Firefox for Android 115+, Opera Android 74+

- Server: Deno 1.31+, Node.js 20.0.0+

Browser compatibility is handled through extensive testing and visualization tools provided by the core-js project. The compatibility data and browser tests are available through the project's website, offering detailed insights into supported versions and environments.

The method's implementation is based on the ECMAScript Language Specification and follows consistent behavior across typed array types. While it's not available in older devices or browsers, developers can leverage polyfills and shims from core-js to ensure compatibility with legacy systems. For environments like Internet Explorer 11, core-js provides comprehensive polyfills through its @babel/runtime integration, enabling modern JavaScript features while maintaining compatibility.


## Example Usage

const originalArray = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 9, 4, 5]);

const reversedArray = originalArray.toReversed();

console.log("Original Array:", originalArray);

console.log("Reversed Array:", reversedArray);

// Output:

// Original Array: Uint8Array(5) [ 1, 2, 9, 4, 5 ]

// Reversed Array: Uint8Array(5) [ 5, 4, 9, 2, 1 ]

The `toReversed()` method specifically targets typed array instances and returns a new array with elements in reverse order. This behavior differs from the `reverse()` method, which mutates the original array and returns it.

For example, given the Uint8Array instance `originalArray`, calling `toReversed()` creates a new Uint8Array with the elements [5, 4, 9, 2, 1]. The original array remains unchanged, demonstrating the method's focus on returning a new array while preserving the immutability of the source data.
