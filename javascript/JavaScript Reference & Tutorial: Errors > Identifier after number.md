# JavaScript Syntax Error: Identifier After Number

In JavaScript, identifiers play a crucial role in naming variables, functions, and properties. While the language offers flexibility in naming conventions, certain rules must be followed to maintain proper syntax. This article explores a specific scenario where JavaScript throws a "SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal." We'll examine how numeric literals affect identifier parsing, discuss common mistakes developers encounter, and provide practical solutions to ensure your code runs smoothly in modern JavaScript environments.


## JavaScript Identifier Rules

Identifiers in JavaScript can only begin with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). They cannot start with a digit. This restriction affects how JavaScript parses code, leading to syntax errors when numeric literals are immediately followed by identifiers.


### Property Accessors and Numeric Separators

The recent addition of numeric separators (ES2021) in JavaScript introduces a complex edge case. While property names like `_500_16` are valid, direct property access via dot notation fails. This is because the dot after the number is interpreted as the start of a decimal fraction, causing the parser to see the method's name as an identifier immediately after a number literal. To access such properties, you must use bracket notation: `myObj[500_16]`.


### Common Pitfalls

Incorrect usage includes variable names like `1life` or methods called directly on numbers without proper syntax. For example:

```javascript

var 1life = 'foo'; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

var life1 = 'foo'; // Valid identifier

```

Bracket notation is crucial when dealing with numbers as property names: `myObj[500_16]` is valid, while `myObj.500_16` would cause a syntax error.


### Browser Support

All modern browsers handle this error consistently, reporting either "SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier after numeric literal" or "SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal" across Edge, Firefox, and Chrome. The error type maintains uniformity regardless of implementation details.

Always ensure identifiers start with letters, underscores, or dollar signs to avoid this error. When working with numeric property names, encapsulate them in quotes or use bracket notation to prevent syntax errors.


## Error Explanation

This error occurs when an identifier in JavaScript starts immediately after a numeric literal. According to the language specification, identifiers must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($), and cannot start with a digit. This restriction affects how JavaScript parses code, leading to a "SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal" when an identifier begins with a number.

Modern browsers consistently report this error, displaying messages like "SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier after numeric literal" in Edge, "SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal" in Firefox, and "SyntaxError: Unexpected number" in Chrome. The error type remains uniform across implementations, with all browsers treating it as a SyntaxError.

The error manifests in various scenarios. Directly using variable names like '1life' causes a SyntaxError, as seen in this example:

```javascript

let 1life = 'foo'; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

```

Renaming the variable to 'life1' resolves the issue:

```javascript

let life1 = 'foo'; // Valid identifier

```

Property access also falls victim to this rule, especially with the introduction of numeric separators in ES2021. While property names like `_500_16` are valid, direct property access via dot notation fails:

```javascript

myObj.500_16 // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

```

Bracket notation provides the correct syntax for accessing such properties:

```javascript

myObj[500_16] // Valid property access

```

This behavior extends to method calls on numbers, where the dot operator causes parsing issues:

```javascript

1.foo // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

```

The proper ways to call methods on numbers are:

```javascript

(1).foo // Wrap number in parentheses

1..foo  // Add extra dot

1[foo]  // Use bracket notation

```

Understanding these rules prevents the "identifier starts immediately after numeric literal" error, ensuring JavaScript code adheres to proper syntax standards.


## Common Error Scenarios

Common scenarios include variable names like '1life' or methods called directly on numbers without proper syntax. This results in the identifier starting immediately after a numeric literal, causing a SyntaxError.

The error also affects property accessors in specific cases, particularly with ES2021's Numeric Separators feature. While property names like `_500_16` are valid, direct property access via dot notation fails. For example:

```javascript

myObj.500_16 // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

```

Using bracket notation resolves this issue:

```javascript

myObj[500_16] // Valid property access

```

Bracket notation must be used when a number serves as a property name, ensuring correct JavaScript syntax. This includes method calls on numbers, where the dot operator causes parsing issues:

```javascript

1.foo // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

```

Proper ways to call methods on numbers are:

```javascript

(1).foo // Wrap number in parentheses

1..foo  // Add extra dot

1[foo]  // Use bracket notation

```

These examples demonstrate the specific error scenarios and required syntax adjustments to avoid "identifier starts immediately after numeric literal" errors in JavaScript.


## Code Examples

The text provides multiple examples of valid and invalid code, demonstrating proper identifier formatting and usage. Common errors include variable names like '1life' or methods called directly on numbers without proper syntax. For instance:

```javascript

var 1life = 'foo'; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

var life1 = 'foo'; // Valid identifier

```

Property access also demonstrates these rules, particularly with ES2021's Numeric Separators feature. While property names like `_500_16` are valid, direct property access via dot notation fails:

```javascript

myObj.500_16 // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

```

Using bracket notation resolves these issues:

```javascript

myObj[500_16] // Valid property access

```

Additional examples include:

```javascript

a = 0611; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

a = 0311; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

a = 0540; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

a = 0110; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

a = 0150; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

a = 0210; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

a = 0220; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

a = 0230; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

a = 1039; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

a = 0511; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

a = 0470; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

a = 0130; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

a = 0050; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

a = 2301; // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

```

These examples consistently show that only valid identifiers can start with letters, underscores, or dollar signs, while numeric literals must be followed by appropriate separators or quotes to prevent syntax errors.


## Solutions and Workarounds

To prevent these errors, always ensure identifiers begin with letters, underscores, or dollar signs. When dealing with numeric property names, encapsulate them in quotes or use bracket notation to prevent syntax errors. For example, replace `var 1life = 'foo';` with `var life1 = 'foo';`, and use bracket notation for property access: `myObj[500_16]` instead of `myObj.500_16`.

The "Unexpected identifier" error can also arise from improper identifier formatting. When using string values, ensure they are enclosed in quotes: `console.log('GeeksForGeeks');` instead of `console.log(GeeksForGeeks);`. Always define and initialize variables before using them in expressions. For example, instead of `let result = 5 + resultValue;`, define `let resultValue = 10` first, then use `let result = 5 + resultValue;`.

Web developers often encounter issues when generating identifiers from numeric literals. When using Webpack's DefinePlugin, always enclose numeric identifiers in quotes: use `"3511a4a"` instead of `3511a4a`. This prevents syntax errors in environments where numeric literals cannot directly follow other tokens. For processing field values, validate input formats to ensure numeric identifiers are properly quoted or handled using bracket notation.
