# BigInt asUintN: JavaScript's Unsigned Integer Conversion Method

In JavaScript, managing large integers requires precise control over arithmetic operations and numeric representations. The introduction of BigInt in recent browser versions offers significant improvements over traditional Number types, particularly for values exceeding safe integer limits. However, working effectively with BigInt requires understanding its nuances, especially when performing operations that span multiple bit widths. In this article, we explore the asUintN method, which enables developers to wrap BigInt values as unsigned integers within specified bit widths. Through detailed examples and practical usage scenarios, we demonstrate how this method extends JavaScript's numeric capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing bitwise operations and numeric constraints.


## BigInt Overview

BigInt represents arbitrary-precision integers in JavaScript. It extends the Number type to handle values beyond the safe integer limits, providing precise arithmetic operations and improved performance compared to third-party libraries.

Creating BigInt values involves appending 'n' to integer literals or using the BigInt() function with integer or string values. The language distinguishes between BigInt and Number using the typeof operator, with BigInt operations following specific rules for numeric conversions and operations.

The asIntN and asUintN methods wrap BigInt values as signed and unsigned integers, respectively. asUintN takes two parameters: the number of least significant bits and the maximum value. For example, BigInt.asUintN(64, 2n ** 64n - 1n) returns 18446744073709551615n (2n ** 64n - 1n), while BigInt.asUintN(64, 2n ** 64n) returns 0n due to overflow.

The method throws RangeError exceptions when the width parameter is negative or greater than 253 - 1. It works by interpreting the BigInt value as a two's complement binary representation. For instance, BigInt.asUintN(4, 25n) truncates 25n (00011001 in binary) to 1001 (base 2) = 9n.


## asUintN Method Details

BigInt.asUintN is a static method that wraps a BigInt value as an unsigned integer. The method takes two parameters: bits, which specifies the number of bits to use for the conversion, and bigint, which is the integer to clamp to fit into the supplied bits.

The method returns the value of bigint modulo 2^bits, as an unsigned integer. For example, BigInt.asUintN(64, 2n ** 64n - 1n) returns 18446744073709551615n, while BigInt.asUintN(64, 2n ** 64n) returns 0n due to overflow. The method throws a RangeError if bits is negative or greater than 253 - 1.

The method works by interpreting the BigInt value as a two's complement binary representation. For instance, BigInt.asUintN(4, 25n) truncates 25n (00011001 in binary) to 1001 (base 2) = 9n.

Here's how you can use the method:

```javascript

console.log(BigInt.asUintN(64, 18446744073709551615n)); // Output: 18446744073709551615n

console.log(BigInt.asUintN(64, 18446744073709551616n)); // Output: 0n

console.log(BigInt.asUintN(8, 255n));                    // Output: 255n

console.log(BigInt.asUintN(8, 256n));                    // Output: 0n

```

The method is most useful for staying within 64-bit arithmetic ranges. It allows you to safely clamp BigInt values to specific bit widths while maintaining their unsigned integer properties.


## Usage Examples

BigInt.asUintN operates by wrapping a BigInt value as an unsigned integer within the specified bit width. This method is particularly useful for maintaining unsigned integer properties while performing operations within a constrained bit range.

For example:

```javascript

console.log(BigInt.asUintN(64, 18446744073709551615n)); // Output: 18446744073709551615n

console.log(BigInt.asUintN(64, 18446744073709551616n)); // Output: 0n

console.log(BigInt.asUintN(8, 255n));                    // Output: 255n

console.log(BigInt.asUintN(8, 256n));                    // Output: 0n

```

The method demonstrates distinct behavior with specific bit widths:

```javascript

let maxlimit = 2n ** (64n - 1n) - 1n;

function GFG(num) {

  (num > maxlimit) ? console.log("Number exceed the limit of signed 64-bit integer!"): console.log(BigInt.asUintN(64, num));

}

GFG(2n ** 16n); // Output: 65536n

GFG(2n ** 32n); // Output: 4294967296n

GFG(2n ** 64n); // Output: Number exceed the limit of signed 64-bit integer!

```

The implementation ensures that the method throws RangeError for invalid parameters:

```javascript

console.log(BigInt.asUintN(-1, 1n)); // Output: Uncaught RangeError: Invalid value: not (convertible to) a safe integer

console.log(BigInt.asUintN(254, 1n)); // Output: Uncaught RangeError: Invalid value: not (convertible to) a safe integer

```

This functionality provides developers with precise control over integer operations while maintaining compatibility with existing bitwise operations and numeric constraints.


## Browser Support

Google Chrome 67 and above fully support the BigInt data type, with Edge 79 and above, Firefox 68 and above, Safari 14 and above, and Opera 54 and above also supporting native implementation. However, for Edge and Safari, native support can be enabled via the javascript.options.bigint setting. Firefox requires manual enablement.

While the current implementation is limited to Chrome, the JSBI library provides JavaScript port functionality that behaves exactly like native BigInt behavior. This library exposes an API through the import statement: `import JSBI from './jsbi.mjs';`. Using JSBI allows writing code that behaves like native BigInt functionality. The main difference is that JSBI requires explicit import statements, while native BigInt support enables automatic compilation when all desired browsers support it.

For comparison with alternative implementations, the V8 blog post reports that while Scala.js has faster JavaScript 64-bit integers than Kotlin or TeaVM (both about 8x slower on Chrome v57.0), the current implementation is reported to be 60x slower than these alternatives. The performance needs to improve 10-fold to match naive user-space implementations and 60x to match Scala.js. The benchmark files, available in a GitHub gist, demonstrate this performance gap, with the native implementation operating at 5,630,596.85 µs/op compared to 89,810.44 µs/op for the user-space implementation. Optimization strategies suggested include snapshotting `BigInt.asIntN` in a local variable of a giant IIFE to improve performance.


## Best Practices

The asUintN method is most effective when used with 64-bit arithmetic, where the maximum non-wrapping value is 18446744073709551615n (2n ** 64n - 1n). When operating within this range, the method provides precise control over integer operations while maintaining unsigned integer properties. It is particularly useful for applications requiring safe integer arithmetic beyond the limits of traditional JavaScript Number types.

Developers should be aware that the method throws RangeError exceptions for invalid parameters. Specifically, bits must be a non-negative integer less than or equal to 253 - 1. As noted in the documentation, the method behaves as follows with 64-bit arithmetic inputs:

- BigInt.asUintN(64, 2n ** 64n - 1n) returns 18446744073709551615n

- BigInt.asUintN(64, 2n ** 64n) returns 0n due to overflow

- BigInt.asUintN(64, 2n ** 64n + 1n) returns 1n

- BigInt.asUintN(64, 2n ** 64n * 2n) returns 0n (wraps on multiples)

- BigInt.asUintN(64, 2n ** 64n * -42n) returns 0n (wraps on negative multiples)

For optimal performance and compatibility, developers are encouraged to use native BigInt support where available. Current implementation limitations, particularly in older browsers, make the JSBI library a practical alternative. This library provides JavaScript port functionality that behaves exactly like native BigInt behavior, allowing developers to write code that operates identically across different environments.
