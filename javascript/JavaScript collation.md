# JavaScript Locale Collation: Understanding and Implementation

JavaScript's locale collation functionality brings cultural sensitivity to string comparison and sorting operations, allowing developers to implement proper sorting algorithms for data across various languages and scripts. While JavaScript's built-in string comparison operates on Unicode code point order, locale collation introduces rules for culturally-specific sorting, such as differentiating between letter cases, diacritical marks, and script-specific sort orders. Understanding this functionality is crucial for developers working with internationalized applications, as proper sorting is essential for displaying data correctly to users from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds. This article explores the implementation details of JavaScript's locale collation, including how to create collator objects, configure collation behavior, and optimize sorting operations for large datasets and multiple scripts.


## JavaScript's Locale Collation Overview

JavaScript's locale collation functionality enables culturally-sensitive string comparison and sorting. When comparing strings, JavaScript can sort in reverse order or produce a comparator function that can be used with Array.sort(). The comparison returns a number indicating the sort order: -1 if the reference string sorts before the compare string, 1 if it sorts after, or 0 if they are equivalent.

The collation process handles unknown characters by sorting them based on their Unicode values after processing known characters according to their specified collation rules. For optimal performance with large datasets, the collator generates sort key strings consisting of three numbers representing primary, secondary, and tertiary character characteristics. These sort key strings maintain correct collation order when compared byte-for-byte, allowing efficient comparison without recalculating collation values for each string.

When working with multiple scripts, JavaScript's locale collation requires specific data files. Full multilingual support uses the DUCET data, totaling multiple megabytes. For single-script support, use locale-provided data, while specific script support requires ISO 15924 code data files. The collator handles unknown characters by sorting them based on their Unicode values after processing known characters according to their specified collation rules.


## Collator Instance Properties and Methods

The Collator instance provides several properties and methods for fine-grained control over locale-sensitive string comparison. These properties and methods enable developers to tailor the collation behavior to specific requirements while maintaining correct sorting.


### Properties

The Collator instance properties enable developers to configure various aspects of the collation behavior:

Locale Matching:

- `getAvailableStyles(locale)`: Returns the collation styles available for a given locale. For German, this includes phonebook and dictionary order options.

Script Order Specification:

- `getAvailableScripts()`: Retrieves the ISO 15924 script codes available in the current collation data. When sorting multiple scripts, the `scriptOrder` property can be set to a space-separated list of script codes to customize the sorting order.

Sensitivity Levels:

- The `sensitivity` property determines the collator's sensitivity to different character distinctions, ranging from "primary" to "variant". Each level specifies a different set of significant character differences.

Usage Configuration:

- The `usage` property defines whether the collator will be used for sorting or searching, with valid values "sort" or "search". Setting this property to "sort" produces a stable order where case-insensitive matches still consider case after other criteria are met.


### Methods

The Collator instance methods provide functionality beyond basic comparison:

Comparator Function Generation:

- The `getComparator()` method returns a comparator function suitable for use with `Array.sort()`, ensuring proper sorting behavior when applied to arrays of strings.

Locale Compatibility Check:

- `Intl.Collator.supportedLocalesOf()` returns an array containing locale tags that are supported in collation without falling back to the runtime's default locale. It accepts an array of BCP 47 language tags and an options object with a `localeMatcher` property.

Performance Optimization:

- For large datasets (10+ items) or sortable UI components, the collator recommends generating sort keys using `Intl.Collator.prototype.compare()` results. This approach improves performance by comparing arrays of values rather than recalculating collation values for each string comparison.


### Browser Support

The `Intl.Collator` object is widely implemented across modern browsers, with support dating back to September 2017. Developers can use static methods like `supportedLocalesOf()` to determine the available locale options for their applications.


## Locale Collation Implementation Considerations

For JavaScript applications handling large datasets or complex sorting requirements, generating sort keys through the `Intl.Collator.prototype.compare()` method is recommended for optimal performance. This approach stores sort key strings in JavaScript, allowing efficient comparison through byte-for-byte comparison of three-number representations of primary, secondary, and tertiary character characteristics.

When working with multiple scripts, JavaScript requires specific data files for correct collation. Full multilingual support necessitates loading DUCET data, totaling multiple megabytes, while specific script support requires ISO 15924 code data files. Single-script support can use either direct data or locale-provided data, but server-side sorting is recommended for large tables, especially when results are retrieved in cursor form. Sorting occurs on the database level to reduce front-end processing time, with Node.js users recommended to install the full-icu package for proper locale collation functionality.

The `Intl.Collator` constructor supports several options for fine-tuning collation behavior, including locale matching, sensitivity levels, script order specification, and usage configuration. The `collation` property can be either specified via the locale string's `-u` extension or through the configuration object argument, with collation types including "primary," "base," "secondary," "accent," "tertiary," "case," "quaternary," and "variant." Each level defines different character distinctions, from case- and accent-insensitive base characters to distinctions between all character forms. The sensitivity property determines the collator's sensitivity to these distinctions, while the upperFirst flag controls case-sensitive sorting in scripts with case concepts. The scriptOrder property allows customization of sorting order for multiple scripts using space-separated ISO 15924 script codes.


## Collation Data Requirements and Management

JavaScript requires specific data files for correct collation, with options for full multilingual support, specific script data, and single-script support. Full multilingual data requires the DUCET data, which can be multiple megabytes in size. For specific script support, use ISO 15924 code data files, while single-script support can use locale-provided data.

Handling unknown characters involves sorting them by Unicode value after processing known characters according to their specified collation rules. For optimal performance with large datasets, especially when results are retrieved in cursor form, sorting occurs on the database level to reduce frontend processing time. In Node.js applications, the full-icu package ensures proper locale collation functionality.

The options parameter in the Collator constructor supports several properties for fine-tuning collation behavior. The locale setting determines the locale for the comparator function, while sensitivity controls the collator's sensitivity to different character distinctions. Script order specification allows customization of sorting order for multiple scripts using space-separated ISO 15924 script codes. The usage property specifies collator usage, producing stable order for sorting or matching case-insensitive matches for searching.


## Web API Support and Browser Compatibility

The Intl.Collator.supportedLocalesOf() method returns supported locale tags for collation operations, ensuring that sorting functions use the correct locale settings. It accepts an array of BCP 47 language tags and an options object with a localeMatcher property (default is "best fit"). The method returns an array of strings representing a subset of the given locale tags that are supported in collation without falling back to the runtime's default locale.

Example usage demonstrates its functionality: given locales ["ban", "id-u-co-pinyin", "de-ID"], the method returns ["id-u-co-pinyin", "de-ID"], indicating supported Indonesian and German collation settings while correctly handling pinyin collation specifics. This feature is well-established across modern browsers, with support dating back to September 2017.

The collator handles unknown characters by sorting them based on their Unicode values after processing known characters according to their specified collation rules. This behavior ensures consistent sorting across different scripts and character sets while maintaining correct ordering for characters with specific collation requirements.
