# JavaScript DataView.setBigUint64 Method

JavaScript's DataView provides methods for reading and writing typed arrays to an ArrayBuffer, including support for 64-bit unsigned integers. This article explores the setBigUint64 method, which stores these large numbers in various byte orders and handles input validation through TypedArray mechanisms. The implementation details vary across browsers, with full support starting in September 2021 for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Opera, while Safari requires big-endian storage when using the littleEndian parameter.


## Method Syntax and Parameters

The method's syntax includes three parameters: byteOffset, val, and littleEndian. The byteOffset parameter specifies the offset, in bytes, from the start of the DataView to store the data. The val parameter represents the unsigned 64-bit integer value to be stored, with a maximum value of 2^64 - 1. The littleEndian parameter is optional and indicates whether the 64-bit integer is stored in little- or big-endian format; it defaults to big-endian if not specified or set to false.

Examples demonstrate setting values at specific byte offsets. For instance, setting a value of 1234n at byte offset 0 and retrieving it results in the expected output of 1234n. Another example sets the 64-bit value 12345678n at byte offset 6 and correctly retrieves it.

The method supports multiple browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, and Safari, with implementation details available for each. Support started in September 2021 across various devices and browser versions. The method works without alignment constraints, allowing multi-byte values to be stored at any offset within bounds.

The method ensures valid input by throwing a RangeError if the byteOffset is set such that it would store beyond the end of the view. It handles value encoding and normalization through TypedArray mechanisms, with overflow causing the value to be set to 0n.


## Setting 64-bit Unsigned Integers

The DataView.setBigUint64 method stores unsigned 64-bit integers (unsigned long long) in an ArrayBuffer, using 8 bytes to represent numbers from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (2^64 - 1). The method supports both big-endian and little-endian storage through the optional littleEndian parameter, which defaults to big-endian if not specified.

According to the specification, the method fits within JavaScript's BigInt API for handling numbers beyond the native double-precision floating-point format limit of 2^53 - 1. The method returns undefined and throws a RangeError if the byteOffset exceeds the ArrayBuffer's bounds. Implementation details show compatibility across modern browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Opera, with support starting in September 2021 across various devices and browser versions.

Each call to setBigUint64 increments the byte offset by 8, allowing multiple values to be stored in sequence. The method ensures valid input by checking the byteOffset against the ArrayBuffer's size, with overflow resulting in a value of 0n according to the specification documentation.


## Byte Order and Endianness

The littleEndian parameter determines whether the 64-bit integer is stored in little- or big-endian format. By default, the method writes in big-endian order if littleEndian is not specified or set to false.

JavaScript implementations handle byte order through the underlying TypedArray mechanisms. For instance, setting a value with littleEndian=false (big-endian) writes the most significant byte first. To demonstrate, setting 1234n at byte offset 0 produces the expected output of 1234n.

The method's implementation varies based on browser support. Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Opera all support the littleEndian parameter for both setBigUint64 and getBigUint64 operations. Safari, however, does not implement this feature, falling back to big-endian storage if the parameter is used.

Developers can test byte order behavior using examples from the specification documentation. For instance, storing 1234n at byte offset 1 returns 72623859790382856n, demonstrating big-endian storage. In contrast, setting the same value at byte offset 6 and retrieving it correctly returns 1234n, showing proper handling of 64-bit integers regardless of their position within the buffer.


## Browser Support

The method's support varies across modern browsers and implementation environments. Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Opera all implement the method fully, with support starting in September 2021 across various devices and browser versions. The method is not supported in Safari, where it falls back to big-endian storage if the littleEndian parameter is used.

Implementation details show compatibility across all modern browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Opera. The method works in both desktop and mobile environments, supporting versions from September 2021 onward. Node.js, Android WebView, and Chrome Android also implement the method fully, while Opera Android supports it in its full range of functionality. Firefox Android provides full support for the method.

The method returns undefined and throws a RangeError when attempting to store beyond the ArrayBuffer's bounds, as documented in the specification. The specification also notes that the method works without alignment constraints, allowing multiple values to be stored in sequence at any valid offset within the buffer.


## Example Usage

A basic example demonstrates storing and retrieving a 64-bit unsigned integer:

```javascript

const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);

const view = new DataView(buffer);

// Set a value and retrieve it

view.setBigUint64(0, 1234567890123456789n);

console.log(view.getBigUint64(0)); // Outputs 1234567890123456789n

// Store multiple values sequentially

view.setBigUint64(8, 9876543210987654321n); // Offset 8 bytes

console.log(view.getBigUint64(8)); // Outputs 9876543210987654321n

```

This code creates an ArrayBuffer of 16 bytes and a DataView to access it. The first call to setBigUint64 stores 1234567890123456789n at byte offset 0, and the subsequent call stores 9876543210987654321n at byte offset 8. Each set operation increments the internal byte offset by 8, allowing sequential storage of multiple 64-bit values.

The following example demonstrates handling value encoding and normalization using JavaScript's BigInt API:

```javascript

const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);

const view = new DataView(buffer);

// Set a value exceeding the maximum representable unsigned integer

view.setBigUint64(0, 2n ** 64n); // 2^64

console.log(view.getBigUint64(0)); // Outputs 0n due to overflow

```

In this scenario, attempting to set the maximum representable 64-bit unsigned integer results in a value of 0n due to overflow. The DataView method correctly normalizes the value according to the spec, ensuring valid input while maintaining expected behavior for out-of-range inputs.
