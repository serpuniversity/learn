# JavaScript WeakMap delete Method

JavaScript's WeakMap provides an efficient way to associate data with objects without preventing those objects from being garbage collected. This unique data structure offers significant advantages over traditional maps, particularly when working with third-party libraries or temporary data. In this guide, we'll explore the delete method of WeakMap, examining its implementation, behavior, and implications for memory management. Through practical examples and considerations for cross-browser compatibility, we'll help you master this essential WeakMap operation.


## WeakMap Overview

WeakMap is a JavaScript data structure that enables storing collections of key-value pairs where the keys must be objects. Unlike regular JavaScript objects, WeakMap keys are weakly referenced, meaning they do not prevent garbage collection. This feature allows key objects to be automatically removed from memory when no longer needed, making WeakMap particularly useful for managing memory efficiently when working with objects that belong to another code or third-party library.


### Key Characteristics and Use Cases

WeakMap pairs well with other JavaScript constructs such as Map, WeakRef, WeakSet, and FinalizationRegistry. It's ideal for scenarios where you need to associate data with objects without preventing the key objects from being garbage collected. For instance, memoization functions can benefit significantly from WeakMap, as demonstrated in the example where it tracks rejected promises without causing memory leaks.

The object's memory remains allocated even if set to null, but this changes when using WeakMap. When an object is garbage collected due to being set to null, its corresponding values in WeakMap become eligible for garbage collection as well, provided they're not strongly referred to elsewhere. This automatic key removal process prevents memory leaks while maintaining efficient data storage.


### Implementation and Browser Support

The WeakMap constructor produces WeakMap objects, with the constructor property returning just a reference to the WeakMap constructor function. While initially supported across various browser versions since July 2015, developers should ensure compatibility with older implementations using polyfills like Jack G's JavaScript Fast Light Map WeakMap Set And WeakSet JS Polyfill library. Modern JavaScript environments widely support WeakMap, making it a robust choice for managing object-associated data.


## delete Method Syntax and Usage

WeakMap.delete() removes a specific element from a WeakMap object by accepting a single parameter representing the element's key. The method returns true if the key-value pair is successfully deleted and false if the key is not found in the WeakMap.


### Syntax and Return Value

The method's syntax follows the pattern:

```javascript

wm.delete(key)

```

Where `wm` is the WeakMap instance and `key` is the required parameter representing the key of the element to remove. The method returns a Boolean value: true if an element has been successfully removed, and false if the key is not found in the WeakMap or if the key is not an object.


### Usage Example

The following examples demonstrate the delete() method's usage:

```javascript

// Example 1

function gfg() {

  const weakmap = new WeakMap();

  const key = {};

  weakmap.set(key, 6);

  console.log(weakmap.delete(key)); // Output: true

  console.log(weakmap.has(key)); // Output: false

}

gfg();

```

```javascript

// Example 2

const weakmap1 = new WeakMap();

const key1 = {};

weakmap1.set(key1, 6);

console.log(weakmap1.delete(key1)); // Output: true

```

```javascript

// Example 3

const weakmap1 = new WeakMap();

const key1 = {};

console.log(weakmap1.delete(key1)); // Output: false

```


### Browser Support

The delete() method has been supported across modern browsers since July 2015:

- Chrome: 36 and above

- Firefox (Gecko): 6 and above

- Internet Explorer: 11 and above

- Opera: 23 and above

- Safari: 
7.1 and above

Note that prior to SpiderMonkey 38 (Firefox 38 / Thunderbird 38 / SeaMonkey 2.35), attempting to delete a non-object key would throw a TypeError. This behavior was fixed in version 38 and later to return false as per the latest ES6 standard (bug 1127827).


## delete Method Behavior

The delete method follows the ECMAScript 2026 Language Specification and returns false if the key is not an object or a non-registered symbol (shared symbols in the global symbol registry). This behavior ensures that the method aligns with the latest standards while maintaining consistency across different JavaScript engines.

When a key is deleted from a WeakMap, the corresponding value is removed regardless of whether the object's memory is immediately freed or not. This automatic cleanup process ensures that WeakMap maintains accurate references even as objects might still be present in memory during the garbage collection cycle. The method's implementation keeps track of all keys for each WeakMap instance, allowing for efficient removal of entries and associated values when the map itself or its key objects change state.

The WeakMap's ability to maintain internal lists of keys enables several practical benefits:

- Efficient .clear operations: When a WeakMap instance dies, the list allows for easy and timely deletion of associated entries and values

- Iteration support: The internal key list enables the implementation to iterate over WeakMap keys for operations like .clear

- Space optimization: While maintaining these lists increases space usage, it's a trade-off for improved performance and memory management capabilities

## delete Method Browser Support

The delete() method of WeakMap instances removes the specified element from the WeakMap. It requires a key parameter representing the element to remove from the WeakMap object and returns true if an element is successfully removed, or false if the key is not found.

Browser support for delete() follows these specifications:

- Chrome: 36 and above

- Firefox (Gecko): 6 and above

- Internet Explorer: 11 and above

- Opera: 23 and above

- Safari: 
7.1 and above

The method aligns with the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) standard and has been updated to return false when attempting to delete non-object keys, addressing an earlier version's TypeError behavior (introduced in SpiderMonkey 38 and resolved in version 38+).

For developers implementing polyfills, the WeakMap's internal key list enables efficient .clear operations and iteration support. While maintaining these lists increases space usage, it provides essential functionality for managing WeakMap instances across different JavaScript runtime environments.
