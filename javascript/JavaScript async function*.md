# JavaScript Async Generators: Understanding async function*

JavaScript's async function* introduces a powerful tool for asynchronous iteration through its unique behavior as both a constructor and an iterator. This article explores the constructor's prototype behavior, function declaration and expression syntax, and the iterator's promise-based results, highlighting how async generators enable efficient, error-handling, and readable asynchronous data processing.


## Constructor Behavior and Prototype Inheritance

When used as a constructor, async function* becomes the new object's prototype, inheriting instance methods from its parent Function object. This behavior is consistent with JavaScript's constructor function mechanism, where the constructor becomes the prototype of the newly created object.

Key aspects of this constructor behavior include:

- The constructor function acts as the prototype for the created object

- Inherits instance methods from its parent Function object

- Prototype chain follows standard JavaScript inheritance patterns


## Function Declaration and Expression Syntax

An async function* creates an AsyncGeneratorFunction object, while the expression form returns a new AsyncGenerator object on each call. This behavior closely mirrors that of regular function declarations and expressions, demonstrating JavaScript's flexible syntax and function behavior.


### Function Declaration

When declared using the async function* syntax, the function behaves like any other function declaration, being hoisted and available for execution throughout its scope. The function appears in the call stack when encountered, and can be called from any location within its scope, providing the same level of flexibility as traditional function declarations.


### Expression Form

The async function* expression behaves analogously to regular function expressions, returning a new AsyncGenerator object each time the expression is evaluated. Like regular function expressions, these can be assigned to variables, used in object literals, or passed as arguments to other functions. The expression form enables the creation of ad-hoc async iterable objects through Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE).


### Anonymous Functions

The async function* syntax also supports anonymous functions, allowing for the creation of functions without explicitly defining a name. This capability extends JavaScript's existing support for anonymous functions, providing developers with greater flexibility in function creation and usage patterns.


## Key Features and Iterator Behavior

Each call to an async generator function's next() method returns a Promise that resolves to the iterator result object. These methods always yield Promise objects, as demonstrated in the MDN Web Docs example:

```javascript

async function* createAsyncGenerator() {

  yield Promise.resolve(1);

  yield await Promise.resolve(2);

  yield 3;

}

const asyncGen = createAsyncGenerator();

asyncGen.next().then((res) => console.log(res.value)); // 1

asyncGen.next().then((res) => console.log(res.value)); // 2

asyncGen.next().then((res) => console.log(res.value)); // 3

```

The returned promises maintain their eventual state, meaning they retain either the resolved value or the reason for rejection. This behavior is consistent with JavaScript's Promise implementation, as noted in the ES2017 specification:

"When an async function is called, it returns a Promise that is initially pending. Once the execution of the async function is complete, the returned promise is either fulfilled with the return value of the async function or rejected with the thrown error."

Since async generator functions always produce promise results, developers can chain these operations using .then() methods, as shown in the MDN Web Docs example:

```javascript

async function* generateNumbers() {

  yield await Promise.resolve(1);

  yield await Promise.resolve(2);

  yield await Promise.resolve(3);

}

const gen = generateNumbers();

gen.next().then((res) => console.log(res.value)); // 1

gen.next().then((res) => console.log(res.value)); // 2

gen.next().then((res) => console.log(res.value)); // 3

```

This chaining behavior allows for the creation of complex asynchronous workflows while maintaining the promise-based nature of JavaScript's asynchronous programming model.


## Asynchronous Data Handling

Async generators enable developers to manage complex asynchronous tasks through a combination of lazy evaluation and value-based flow control. They achieve this through several key mechanisms:


### Lazy Evaluation and Value-Based Flow Control

Generator functions allow pausing and resuming execution, making them ideal for scenarios where data processing needs to be deferred. This behavior is particularly useful for handling large datasets or long-running processes, as the generator generates values on-the-fly rather than computing them all upfront.


### Data Streams and Asynchronous Operations

The primary application of async generators is in managing data streams from various sources, including databases, APIs, and real-time event streams. They achieve this through sequential execution of asynchronous tasks, ensuring that each operation completes before the next begins. This approach improves code readability and maintainability, making it easier for developers to understand the flow of operations.


### Error Handling and Graceful Shutdown

The combination of async functions and generator functions provides robust error handling capabilities. Developers can use try/catch blocks within generator functions to handle rejected promises efficiently. This feature is particularly important for applications that need to maintain proper state and respond appropriately to errors during data processing.


### Real-Time Data Synchronization

Asynchronous generators excel in handling real-time data synchronization, a common requirement in modern web applications. They enable developers to create efficient solutions for processing streams of data, such as updating UI components in response to network events. The technology's ability to maintain state between calls makes it particularly well-suited for scenarios where data processing needs to be both responsive and efficient.


### Improved Readability through Sequential Execution

By combining generators with async/await syntax, developers achieve improved code readability while maintaining efficient execution. This approach allows writing asynchronous code that reads like synchronous code, making it easier for both experienced and novice developers to understand and maintain the application's logic.


## Error Handling and Promise Integration

async function* fetchWithErrorHandling(urls) {

  for (const url of urls) {

    try {

      const response = await fetch(url);

      if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Error fetching ${url}`);

      const data = await response.json();

      yield data;

    } catch (error) {

      console.error(error);

    }

  }

}

The fetchWithErrorHandling function demonstrates async generator behavior with error handling. Each fetch request is wrapped in a try/catch block, allowing developers to handle rejected promises efficiently within the generator function.


### Error Handling Implementation

To implement error handling in async generators, developers can use try/catch blocks to catch rejected promises:

```javascript

async function* createAsyncGenerator() {

  try {

    yield await Promise.resolve(1);

  } catch (error) {

    console.error('Error in generator', error);

  } finally {

    console.log('Generator completion');

  }

}

const gen = createAsyncGenerator();

gen.next().then((res) => console.log(res.value)); // 1

gen.next().catch((error) => console.error(error)); // Error in generator

gen.next().then(() => console.log('final state')); // Generator completion

```


### Graceful Shutdown

Graceful shutdown is crucial for async generators to ensure proper cleanup and resource release:

```javascript

async function* periodicUpdate() {

  try {

    while (true) {

      yield await getCurrentData();

      await sleep(5000); // Simulate periodic processing

    }

  } catch (error) {

    console.error('Error in periodic update', error);

  } finally {

    console.log('Periodic update complete');

  }

}

const updateGen = periodicUpdate();

updateGen.next().then(() => updateGen.next()); // Trigger initial update

// Simulate stopping the generator

updateGen.return().then(() => console.log('Generator returned'));

```


### Best Practices

Developers should follow these best practices when implementing error handling in async generators:

- Always include try/catch blocks around asynchronous operations

- Use finally to ensure cleanup and resource release

- Return values from generators to signal completion or success

- Handle errors explicitly rather than relying on uncaught exceptions
