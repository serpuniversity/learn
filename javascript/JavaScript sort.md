# JavaScript TypedArray Sorting Methods

In JavaScript, working with large datasets efficiently often requires leveraging the right data structure and method combination. While standard arrays offer fundamental methods like sort(), the TypedArray objects provide specialized sorting mechanisms optimized for their unique characteristics. Understanding how to implement and optimize sorting for typed arrays can significantly boost performance in applications that process numerical or binary data. This article explores the nuances of sorting typed arrays, examining the built-in methods, performance considerations, and modern alternatives introduced in recent JavaScript standards.


## Sorting Typed Arrays

The basic approach to sorting typed arrays in JavaScript is to use `Array.prototype.sort.call` with a custom comparison function. This method allows for precise control over the sorting behavior and can be adapted for various data types and comparison requirements.

The custom comparison function should return a negative value if the first argument is less than the second, a positive value if the first is greater, and zero if they are equal. A simple implementation for numerical sorting follows:

```javascript

function compareNumbers(a, b) {

  if (a < b) {

    return -1;

  } else if (a === b) {

    return 0;

  } else {

    return 1;

  }

}

```

This function can be used with typed arrays as follows:

```javascript

var numbers = new Int32Array([3, 8, 6, 1, 6, 9]);

Array.prototype.sort.call(numbers, compareNumbers);

console.log(numbers); // Output: Int32Array [1, 3, 6, 6, 8, 9]

```

The ES6 TypedArray prototype provides a more direct approach to sorting through the `sort()` method, which applies numeric comparison by default and can accept a custom compare function through its `compareFn` parameter:

```javascript

var numbers = new Int32Array([3, 8, 6, 1, 6, 9]);

console.log(numbers.sort()); // Output: Int32Array [1, 3, 6, 6, 8, 9]

```

The sort() method is generally more efficient and convenient for typed arrays compared to manually invoking Array.prototype.sort.call. However, developers should be aware of its "obnoxious semantics" as noted by the ECMAScript specification, which may impact performance in certain specialized cases.


## ES6 TypedArray.prototype.sort

The ES6 TypedArray.prototype.sort method provides a specialized sorting mechanism for TypedArray instances that performs numeric comparisons by default. This method returns the reference to the same typed array, now sorted, rather than creating a new array as Array.prototype.sort does.

The sort() method takes an optional compareFn parameter that determines the sort order. The compare function should return:

- A negative value if a is less than b

- A positive value if a is greater than b

- Zero if they are equal

- NaN is treated as 0

The comparison function is called with two parameters: a (the first element for comparison) and b (the second element for comparison). It's important to note that if omitted, the typed array elements are sorted according to numeric value, not string comparison as with Array.prototype.sort.

The sort algorithm follows these key steps:

1. Retrieve values from the source buffer

2. Set values in the target buffer

3. Advance source and target indices

This implementation uses a hybrid approach combining Quicksort and Insertion Sort. For arrays shorter than 11 elements, V8 immediately switches to Insertion Sort. For arrays 10 or fewer elements, V8 uses Insertion Sort as a fallback, using three comparisons: one to determine the pivot and two for partitioning.

While both TypedArray.sort and Array.prototype.sort can perform numeric comparisons, ES6's TypedArray.sort applies this default behavior directly, making it more convenient for typed array operations. However, developers should be aware that both methods have specific limitations and requirements, particularly regarding their handling of equal elements and potential performance implications.


## Custom Comparison Functions

To implement custom comparison functions for TypedArray sorting, developers can use the compareFn parameter, which accepts a function that returns a number indicating the comparison result. This function should return a negative number if the first argument is less than the second, a positive number if the first is greater, and zero if they are equal.

Here's a detailed implementation example based on the provided data:

```javascript

function compareNumbers(a, b) {

  if (a < b) {

    return -1;

  } else if (a === b) {

    return 0;

  } else {

    return 1;

  }

}

var numbers = new Int32Array([3, 8, 6, 1, 6, 9]);

Array.prototype.sort.call(numbers, compareNumbers);

console.log(numbers); // Output: Int32Array [1, 3, 6, 6, 8, 9]

```

When using the ES6 TypedArray.sort method, developers can define custom sorting logic directly:

```javascript

const T_array = new Uint8Array([10, 2, 1, 200, 50]);

T_array.sort(compareNumbers);

console.log(T_array); // Output: Uint8Array [1, 2, 10, 50, 200]

```

The compareFn parameter supports various sorting scenarios. For example, to sort strings while treating "Dr." values specially:

```javascript

function sortWithDrFirst(a, b) {

  if (a.startsWith("Dr.") && !b.startsWith("Dr.")) {

    return -1;

  } else if (!a.startsWith("Dr.") && b.startsWith("Dr.")) {

    return 1;

  }

  return a.localeCompare(b);

}

const names = ["Mike Smith", "Dr. Johnson", "John Doe", "Dr. Williams"];

names.sort(sortWithDrFirst);

console.log(names); // Output: ["Dr. Johnson", "Dr. Williams", "Mike Smith", "John Doe"]

```

The toSorted() method provides a secure alternative for creating a new sorted array:

```javascript

const books = [

  { title: "Book A", year: 2010 },

  { title: "Book B", year: 2005 },

  { title: "Book C", year: 2018 },

];

const booksSortedByYearAsc = books.toSorted((a, b) => a.year - b.year);

console.log(booksSortedByYearAsc); // Output: [ { title: "Book B", year: 2005 }, { title: "Book A", year: 2010 }, { title: "Book C", year: 2018 } ]

```

Developers should note that while custom functions provide flexibility, they can also impact performance. The provided performance data shows a 12x difference between the default sort and using a compare function, and 6x slower performance when combining sort() with reverse(). The choice between built-in sort() and toSorted() depends on whether a new array is needed and the specific requirements of the sorting logic.


## Performance Considerations

While the difference between sorting typed arrays and regular arrays is not significant in terms of performance, the built-in sort methods exhibit distinct behaviors that impact efficiency and predictability. The ES6 TypedArray.prototype.sort method performs numeric comparison by default, offering a more direct approach compared to Array.prototype.sort, which requires lexicographic comparison.

Performance benchmarks reveal that custom compare functions significantly affect sorting speed. The comparison between sort() and sort(compareFn) demonstrates a 12x difference in ascending order performance (1.812ms vs 0.14ms) and a 6x gap in descending order (1.764ms vs 7.77ms). These differences highlight the computational overhead of custom comparison logic.

Understanding the internal implementation is crucial for optimizing performance. The method employs a hybrid approach combining Quicksort and Insertion Sort. For arrays shorter than 11 elements, V8 switches to Insertion Sort immediately. For arrays 10 or fewer elements, a fallback mechanism uses three comparisons: one to determine the pivot and two for partitioning.

The algorithm's stability is influenced by how comparator functions handle equal values. While ECMAScript doesn't guarantee specific behavior when return values are zero, MDN documentation notes potential implementation differences across engines. This uncertainty affects predictability, particularly in edge cases like binary arrays of length 11, where improper sorting can occur.

For developers implementing custom sorting logic, the compare function's impact on performance cannot be overstated. The example comparing "sort()" and "sort(compareFn)" demonstrates significant performance differences, making the choice between built-in and custom implementations critical for efficient array manipulation.


## Modern Sorting Methods

The ES2023 TypedArray.prototype.toSorted method provides a secure and efficient way to order elements of a typed array in ascending order. This method returns a new typed array with sorted elements, similar to Array.prototype.toSorted but with a default numeric sorting behavior.

The method accepts two parameters:

- A compareFn function that determines element order. If omitted, the typed array elements are sorted according to numeric value.

- This compareFn function takes two parameters: a and b, representing the values to be compared.

The method returns a new typed array that has been created with elements in ascending order.

Example usage:

```javascript

const numbers = new Int16Array([5, 1, 8, 3, 2]);

const sortedNumbers = numbers.toSorted();

console.log(sortedNumbers); // Output: Int16Array(5) [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

console.log(numbers); // Output: Int16Array(5) [5, 1, 8, 3, 2]

```

For string sorting, a custom compareFn can be provided:

```javascript

const fruits = new Uint8Array([79, 97, 100, 101, 82, 99]);

function stringCompare(a, b) {

  return String.fromCharCode(a).localeCompare(String.fromCharCode(b));

}

const sortedFruits = fruits.toSorted(stringCompare);

console.log(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, sortedFruits)); // Output: acdeOR

```

The toSorted method is supported in all modern browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, and Safari. Its implementation follows the ECMAScript 2026 Language Specification and provides the same algorithm as Array.prototype.toSorted, with the key difference being default numeric sorting for typed arrays.

Performance considerations: While the exact performance impact is not detailed in the specification, the method is designed to efficiently create a new sorted array while preserving the original array's data. This secure alternative to in-place sorting helps prevent side effects that can occur with the standard sort methods.
