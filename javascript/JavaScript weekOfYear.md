# JavaScript's PlainDate.weekOfYear Method

Understanding how JavaScript calculates the week of the year can be crucial for applications that need to analyze or display date-related data correctly. The ISO-8601 standard provides specific rules for determining a week's position in a year, which can affect everything from calendar displays to financial calculations. This article examines JavaScript's implementation of ISO-8601 week calculations, focusing on how the `PlainDate.weekOfYear` method works to provide accurate week numbers while handling various edge cases and calendar complexities.


## weekOfYear Method Overview

The weekOfYear method in JavaScript's PlainDate object returns the week of the year according to ISO-8601 standards. The calculation follows these key principles:

- The first week of the year is defined as the week containing the first Thursday.

- Weeks are numbered from 1 to 52 or 53, depending on the specific week's position in the year.

- The year associated with a week may differ from the standard year property, potentially being the previous or following year for weeks near January 1st.

The method handles various calendar-specific properties:

- dayOfWeek: Returns the weekday number (1-7) for the ISO 8601 calendar, with Monday as 1 and Sunday as 7.

- daysInWeek: Always 7 for ISO 8601, while other calendar systems may vary.

- daysInYear: 365 or 366 for ISO 8601, depending on whether it's a leap year.

- monthsInYear: Always 12 for ISO 8601.

- inLeapYear: A boolean indicating whether the year is a leap year (true for leap years, false otherwise).

The week calculation process involves determining the position of the first Thursday in the year and measuring the target date's position relative to that anchor point. This approach ensures compliance with ISO-8601 standards while handling edge cases such as:

- Days near the beginning or end of the year

- Leap years affecting the calendar structure

- Regional differences in first-day-of-week settings

The implementation handles these complexities through the following steps:

1. Creating a temporary date set to the target year's first Thursday

2. Adjusting the target date to align with this anchor point

3. Calculating the week number based on the target date's position within the year

This method provides a robust framework for week calculations in JavaScript, ensuring accurate results across various date scenarios while maintaining compliance with international standards.


## weekOfYear Method Implementation

The weekOfYear calculation follows these key steps:

1. Determine the first Thursday of the year: This serves as the anchor point for week calculations.

2. Adjust the target date to the same day of the week as the first Thursday: This ensures the calculation starts from the correct reference point.

3. Calculate the week number: This is done by finding the difference between the target date and the first Thursday, then dividing by 604800000 milliseconds (the number of milliseconds in 7 days) and adding 1.


### Key Implementation Details

- The method accounts for the day of the week system, with Monday as the first day of the week.

- Leap years affect the calculation through their impact on the calendar structure, but the method handles these cases correctly.

- The implementation works with both European and non-European week systems, covering different first-day-of-week settings.


### Browser Compatibility and Implementation Options

- The method is currently available in modern JavaScript environments through Temporal polyfills.

- Alternative implementations exist that provide similar functionality, including ones that use UTC methods to avoid timezone-related issues.


### Technical Implementation

The core logic involves:

1. Calculating the first Thursday of the year

2. Adjusting the target date to match this reference point

3. Using the difference between these dates to determine the week number

This approach ensures accurate week calculations while adhering to ISO-8601 standards across various date scenarios.


## weekOfYear Method Edge Cases

The method handles edge cases through its implementation details and options:


### Daylight Saving Time Transitions

The method handles Daylight Saving Time transitions correctly through its underlying Temporal API implementation. This includes:

- Automatically adjusting for time zone changes

- Using the correct time zone offset during transitions

- Handling cases where a date doesn't exist (like the hour after DST starts in Spring) through its disambiguation options


### Years with January 1 on a Friday

Years where January 1 falls on a Friday cause the first week to span both years. The method correctly identifies these cases and returns 53 for the last week of December when necessary.


### Time Zone Settings

The method works consistently across different time zones, including:

- Handling non-Gregorian calendars through calendar support

- Working correctly with month 1 starting at January (non-zero based)

- Managing leap years and their impact on calendar structure

- Ensuring consistent results across different first-day-of-week settings


## weekOfYear Method Usage

To retrieve the week number of a date, you can use the following JavaScript function, which closely mirrors the underlying implementation of `Temporal.PlainDate.prototype.weekOfYear`:

```javascript

function getWeek(date) {

  const weekNo = date.weekOfYear();

  const year = date.yearOfWeek();

  return { week: weekNo, year };

}

```

This function returns an object containing both the week number and the corresponding yearOfWeek. For example, if you call `getWeek(new Temporal.PlainDate(2023, 0, 4))`, it will return `{ week: 1, year: 2022 }` since 4 January 2023 falls within the last week of 2022 according to ISO-8601 standards.

To demonstrate its usage, consider this scenario: you want to find out the week number of 1 October 2022. You would create a Temporal.PlainDate object for this date and then use the function:

```javascript

const date = Temporal.PlainDate.from('2022-10-01');

const weekInfo = getWeek(date);

console.log(`The date ${date.toString()} belongs to week ${weekInfo.week} of year ${weekInfo.year}`);

```

This would output: `The date 2022-10-01 belongs to week 40 of year 2022`.

For dates near the beginning or end of the year, particularly those close to January 1st, the behavior may vary between calendar systems. For instance, if you have a date on December 31, 2022, the week number would be 1 of the following year rather than 52 of the current year. This is correctly calculated using the `yearOfWeek` property, which returns the appropriate year based on the week's position.

When manipulating dates, you can change the weekOfYear value by adding or subtracting weeks using the `add` or `subtract` methods:

```javascript

const date = new Temporal.PlainDate(2023, 0, 4); // Last Thursday of 2022

const previousWeekDate = date.subtract({ weeks: 1 });

console.log(previousWeekDate.toString()); // 2022-12-29

```

This demonstrates how the weekOfYear and yearOfWeek properties work together to provide accurate week calculations while maintaining calendar-dependent behavior.


## weekOfYear Method Compatibility

The weekOfYear method's compatibility spans multiple JavaScript versions and environments through its implementation across both native JavaScript and polyfill libraries:

- Modern browsers support the method via JavaScript's Temporal API, providing consistent behavior across implementations.

- Polyfills like Temporal.js enable compatibility with older JavaScript environments, ensuring the method works in various runtime contexts.

- The implementation works across different time zones and calendar systems, supporting both Gregorian and non-Gregorian calendars.

In practice, the method's cross-environment compatibility is demonstrated through its consistent behavior when used with JavaScript's native Date objects and Temporal API instances:

- Native Date objects' week calculation matches Temporal.PlainDate's implementation for most use cases

- The method correctly handles time zone transitions and daylight saving time changes through its underlying Temporal API

- Leap years and month structures are managed consistently across implementations

The method's compatibility is further enhanced through its handling of edge cases:

- Correctly processes dates near the beginning or end of the year, including cases where January 1 falls on a Friday

- Properly manages time zone differences and transitions to ensure accurate week calculations
