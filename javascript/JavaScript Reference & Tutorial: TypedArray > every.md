# JavaScript TypedArray: every

JavaScript's TypedArray.prototype.every method offers a powerful way to validate all elements in a typed array against a specific condition. Similar to Array.prototype.every, this method applies a callback function to each element, checking if the entire array meets the specified criteria. Through both traditional and arrow function syntax, every efficiently processes arrays, returning true only when every element satisfies the given condition. This article explores every's implementation, usage, and importance in JavaScript development, highlighting its role in array validation and data integrity checks.


## The every Method

The TypedArray.prototype.every method tests whether all elements in a typed array satisfy a given condition using a callback function. This method implements the same algorithm as Array.prototype.every, passing three parameters to the callback: the current element, its index, and the array itself.

The method syntax is typedarray.every(callback[, thisArg]), where callback receives three arguments: currentValue, index, and array. The thisArg parameter allows specifying the this value for the callback function.

Here's how you can use every() with arrow functions for a more concise syntax:

```javascript

const isBigEnough = (element, index, array) => element >= 10;

new Uint8Array([12, 5, 8, 130, 44]).every(isBigEnough); // false

new Uint8Array([12, 54, 18, 130, 44]).every(isBigEnough); // true

```

The method returns true if the callback returns a truthy value for every array element, otherwise false. With arrow functions, the implementation looks similar:

```javascript

new Uint8Array([12, 5, 8, 130, 44]).every(elem => elem >= 10); // false

new Uint8Array([12, 54, 18, 130, 44]).every(elem => elem >= 10); // true

```

The method performs an iteration until it finds an element where the callback returns a falsy value, at which point it immediately returns false. If no such element is found, it returns true. The callback function can be used to perform operations based on the current element, its index, and the array itself.


## Callback Function Details

The callback function receives three parameters: the current element, its index, and the array itself. This function has the flexibility to perform operations based on these three pieces of information.

The first parameter, `currentValue`, represents the value of the current element being processed in the array. The second parameter, `index`, indicates the index of the current element in the array. The third parameter, `array`, provides the reference to the array object being traversed.

The callback function should return a truthy value to indicate that the element passes the test, and a falsy value otherwise. If the callback returns a truthy value for all elements, the `every` method returns true. As soon as the callback returns a falsy value for any element, the method returns false and immediately stops iterating through the array.


## Method Syntax and Parameters

This method has the same algorithm as Array.prototype.every(), with the callback function receiving three arguments: the current element, its index, and the array itself. The callback function should return a truthy value to indicate that the element passes the test, and a falsy value otherwise.

The method can be invoked using either traditional function syntax or arrow function syntax. Here's an example demonstrating its usage with arrow functions for a more concise implementation:

```javascript

function isBigEnough(element, index, array) { return element >= 10; }

new Uint8Array([12, 5, 8, 130, 44]).every(isBigEnough); // false

new Uint8Array([12, 54, 18, 130, 44]).every(isBigEnough); // true

new Uint8Array([12, 5, 8, 130, 44]).every(elem => elem >= 10); // false

new Uint8Array([12, 54, 18, 130, 44]).every(elem => elem >= 10); // true

```

The method returns true if the callback returns a truthy value for every array element, otherwise it returns false. The callback function receives three arguments: the current element, its index, and the array itself. The this value ultimately observable by callback is determined according to the usual rules for determining the this seen by a function (thisArg parameter can be provided to specify the this value).

The method performs an iteration until it finds an element where the callback returns a falsy value, at which point it immediately returns false. If no such element is found, it returns true. The method does not mutate the typed array on which it is called and is supported across modern browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, and Safari, with full support starting from Chrome 45.0 and Firefox 37.0.


## Method Return Value

The every() method returns true if the callback function returns a truthy value for every array element, otherwise it returns false. This behavior mirrors the "for all" quantifier in mathematics, where the statement about every element is only true if it holds for all elements in the array.

The method processes the array in sequence from the first element to the last. If the callback function returns a falsy value for any element, the method immediately returns false without further evaluation. Only when the callback returns a true value for all elements does the method conclude with true. This mechanism ensures efficient termination of the evaluation when the first non-conforming element is encountered, optimizing performance for large arrays.

The method's return value is determined based on the truthiness of the callback's return values across all elements, making it a powerful tool for array validation and data integrity checks.


## Browser Compatibility

Basic support for the every method is available in Chrome 45.0, Firefox 37, Internet Explorer (no support), Opera 36.0, and Safari (no support). The method is part of the ECMAScript specification and has been supported across modern browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, and Safari since Chrome 45.0 and Firefox 37.0.

The method can be used with arrow functions for a more concise implementation. For example:

```javascript

function isBigEnough(element, index, array) { return element >= 10; }

new Uint8Array([12, 5, 8, 130, 44]).every(isBigEnough); // false

new Uint8Array([12, 54, 18, 130, 44]).every(isBigEnough); // true

new Uint8Array([12, 5, 8, 130, 44]).every(elem => elem >= 10); // false

new Uint8Array([12, 54, 18, 130, 44]).every(elem => elem >= 10); // true

```

Node.js supports the method from version 4.0.0. The callback function receives three arguments: the current element, its index, and the array itself. The method returns true if the callback function returns a truthy value for every array element, otherwise it returns false. The callback function can also be provided with an optional thisArg parameter to specify the value used as this when executing the callback.

The method processes the array in sequence from the first element to the last. If the callback function returns a falsy value for any element, the method immediately returns false without further evaluation. Only when the callback returns true value for all elements does the method conclude with true. This mechanism ensures efficient termination of the evaluation when the first non-conforming element is encountered, optimizing performance for large arrays.

The method is implemented according to the usual rules for determining the this seen by a function, and it does not mutate the typed array on which it is called. The method's implementation and behavior are consistent with Array.prototype.every, providing a powerful tool for array validation and data integrity checks in JavaScript applications.
