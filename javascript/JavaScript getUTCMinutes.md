# JavaScript Date.getUTCMinutes() and Related Methods

JavaScript provides several methods for manipulating date and time, with getUTCMinutes() specifically designed to retrieve the minutes component of a specified date and time according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This function, which returns an integer between 0 and 59, plays a crucial role in accurately handling and converting local time representations to UTC. Understanding how getUTCMinutes() works, including its interaction with related methods and its behavior in edge cases, is essential for developers working with time zone conversions and global time standards in JavaScript applications.


## getUTCMinutes Method

The getUTCMinutes() method retrieves the minutes from a specified date and time according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This method returns an integer value between 0 and 59, where 0 indicates no minutes after the hour, and 59 represents the last minute of the hour. However, if the date specified has a day greater than 31, the method returns NaN (not a number), as no valid date exists for that month.

The method requires a valid Date object created using the Date() constructor. When no date is specified, getUTCMinutes() returns the current UTC minutes. It's important to note that getUTCMinutes() operates on UTC time, meaning it assumes the date represents local time. This is in contrast to getMinutes(), which returns the local time's minute component.

For example, when called on a date object representing February 8, 2024, 10:30 UTC, getUTCMinutes() would return 30. If an invalid date string is provided, such as 'iunnub', the method returns NaN.

This method is supported across all major browsers since ECMAScript 1 (JavaScript 1997), making it available in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer. The implementation details follow the JavaScript specification and handle date component overflow and underflow by carrying over or borrowing from higher segments, ensuring accurate UTC time representation.


## Method Usage and Return Value

The getUTCMinutes() method returns the minutes component of a specified date and time according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This method requires a valid Date object and returns an integer value between 0 and 59, representing the minutes portion of the specified UTC time.

When no date is specified, getUTCMinutes() returns the current UTC minutes. However, it's important to note that getUTCMinutes() operates on UTC time, which means it treats the date as local time. For example, when called on a date object representing February 8, 2024, 10:30 UTC, getUTCMinutes() would return 30. If an invalid date string is provided, such as 'iunnub', the method returns NaN.

All major browser versions support this method, which has been part of ECMAScript since its 1997 release. The implementation details follow the JavaScript specification, handling date component overflow and underflow by carrying over or borrowing from higher segments to ensure accurate UTC time representation.


## Syntax and Parameters

The getUTCMinutes() method requires a valid Date object instance and accepts no parameters. It returns an integer value between 0 and 59, representing the minutes component of the specified UTC time.

When creating a Date object using the constructor, the method expects the following valid date and time components:

- `year`: An integer value representing the year. Values from 0 to 99 map to the years 1900 to 1999, while all other values represent the actual year. For example, year 15 represents the year 2015.

- `month`: An optional integer value representing the month, with January as 0 and December as 11. Note that the `getUTC*()` methods treat a monthIndex of 15 as equivalent to a year increase and a month index of 3. For example, Date.UTC(2020, 15, 1) is interpreted as Date.UTC(2021, 3, 1).

- `day`: An optional integer value representing the day of the month, with values from 1 to 31. The method returns NaN for invalid dates.

- `hours`: An optional integer value between 0 and 23 representing the hour of the day. Defaults to 0 if not provided.

- `minutes`: An optional integer value representing the minute segment of a time. Defaults to 0 if not provided.

- `seconds`: An optional integer value representing the second segment of a time. Defaults to 0 if not provided.

- `milliseconds`: An optional integer value representing the millisecond segment of a time. Defaults to 0 if not provided.


### Browser Compatibility

The Date.UTC() method, which implements similar functionality to Date.getUTCMinutes(), has been supported across all major browsers since JavaScript's 1997 release, making getUTCMinutes() available in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer. The implementation details follow the JavaScript specification and handle date component overflow and underflow by carrying over or borrowing from higher segments, ensuring accurate UTC time representation.


## Browser Compatibility

This function operates consistently across all major browsers and adheres strictly to the ECMAScript 1 standard from its 1997 release. Browser compatibility details indicate full support in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer, with implementation following the JavaScript specifications.

The method's behavior remains consistent with related UTC time functions. For instance, similar to getUTCHours() and getUTCDate(), getUTCMinutes() treats the input date as local time before converting it to UTC. This approach ensures proper handling of daylight saving time transitions and regional time zones when working with UTC times.


## Related Methods

The getUTCMinutes() method works in tandem with its local counterpart, getMinutes(), both returning a number between 0 and 59 representing the minute component of the specified date. However, while getMinutes() returns the local time's minute component, getUTCMinutes() operates on UTC time, treating the input date as local time before converting it to UTC.

This distinction becomes particularly important in time zones that are not on 60-minute boundaries, such as India, which has an additional 30-minute offset from UTC. In these cases, getMinutes() and getUTCMinutes() can differ by 30 minutes, requiring developers to choose the appropriate method based on their specific time zone requirements.

All JavaScript getUTC methods assume the date represents local time. The Date object handles overflow and underflow of date components by carrying over or borrowing from higher segments. For example, setting the month to 12 results in January of the next year, while setting the day to 0 effectively becomes the last day of the previous month.

The underlying implementation follows the JS specification, which represents dates as a single number (timestamp) interpreted as either local time or Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The local timezone is determined by the host environment (user's device), while UTC is the global standard time defined by the World Time Standard. This design ensures consistent handling of daylight saving time transitions and regional time zones when working with UTC times.
