# JavaScript String fromCharCode() Method

JavaScript provides several methods for working with strings, including the String.fromCharCode() method. This method allows developers to create strings from Unicode values, supporting both single and surrogate pair characters. Understanding how to use and properly implement this method is crucial for working with text data in JavaScript applications.


## Basic Usage

The fromCharCode() method returns a string created from the specified sequence of UTF-16 code units, with support for both single and surrogate pair characters. It requires numeric values as arguments, which can be either decimal or hexadecimal. The method converts these numeric values to their corresponding Unicode characters and supports Unicode values from 0 to 65535, truncating values above 0xFFFF to the last 16 bits.

When creating strings with single Unicode values, it produces characters from the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) using a single code unit. Supplementary characters requiring two code units (surrogate pairs) in UTF-16 can be generated by passing each code unit as a separate argument. The method processes values greater than 65535 through specific truncation logic: negative numbers have 65536 added until they fall within the valid range, while values exceeding 65535 have 65536 subtracted until they are valid.

The method can be used to generate random strings through combinations with Math.random() and Math.floor() functions or to decode Unicode escape sequences by parsing hexadecimal values. It returns a string representing the characters for the provided Unicode values and operates as a static method of the String object, requiring the syntax String.fromCharCode() rather than being called on a String object instance.


## Unicode Support

The method supports Unicode values from 0 to 65535, with values above 0xFFFF truncated to the last 16 bits. According to the ECMAScript 2026 Language Specification, the method accepts arguments representing UTF-16 code units within this range. Numbers outside the valid range undergo specific truncation logic: negative values have 65536 added until they fall within the range, while values exceeding 65535 have 65536 subtracted until they are valid.

The method works by converting Unicode code points into UTF-16 code units. For BMP characters (Basic Multilingual Plane) that use a single code unit in UTF-16, any value above 65535 will be truncated to fit within this limit. Supplementary characters requiring two code units in UTF-16 must be passed as separate arguments, but their code point values are first adjusted to fit within the 16-bit limit before conversion.

The conversion process ensures that all returned characters are valid Unicode values within the 65535 range. This allows developers to reliably generate strings from Unicode values while maintaining correct character representation.


## Character Conversion

The conversion process begins with the method accepting one or more numeric values representing Unicode code units. These values can be provided as decimal or hexadecimal, though the method's syntax uniformly treats them as numbers. The method processes each value within the 0 to 65535 range, with specific truncation logic applied to values outside this range: negative numbers have 65536 added until they fall within the valid range, while values exceeding 65535 have 65536 subtracted until they are valid.

For single code unit characters (Basic Multilingual Plane), the method returns the corresponding character directly. Supplementary characters requiring two code units in UTF-16 are processed by the method as separate arguments, though their underlying code point values are first adjusted to fit within the 16-bit limit. This ensures that all returned characters represent valid Unicode values within the 65535 range.

The method returns a string representing the characters for the provided Unicode values, with the text specifying that this is achieved through the conversion of UTF-16 code units into characters. It's worth noting the deprecated nature of the method in favor of String.fromCodePoint() when working with supplementary characters, as the latter allows returning characters based on their actual code point value rather than surrogate pairs. The method's functionality aligns with broader JavaScript string handling capabilities, providing a direct way to convert Unicode values into their character representations.


## Method Variations

The method accepts one or more arguments that must be numeric values, though most commonly used values are provided as decimal or hexadecimal representations (MDN Web Docs, Basics of Javascript).

The method works as follows for basic character conversion: It converts numeric values to their corresponding Unicode characters, with conversion failures defaulting to value zero (MDN Web Docs, Basics of Javascript). For BMP characters, which use a single code unit in UTF-16, the method returns characters directlyâ€”such as "ABC" from values 65, 66, and 67 (MDN Web Docs, String.fromCharCode() - JavaScript).

When dealing with supplementary characters requiring two code units (surrogate pairs) in UTF-16, the method processes each code unit as a separate argument. For example, both `String.fromCharCode(0xd83c, 0xdf03)` and "\ud83c\udf03" return code point U+1F303 "Night with Stars" (MDN Web Docs, String.fromCharCode() - JavaScript). The text notes that while there is a mathematical relationship between supplementary code point values and their surrogate pairs, manual calculation is not recommended (Basics of Javascript).

The method performs specific truncation logic for values outside the 0-65535 range: negative numbers have 65536 added until they fall within the valid range, while values exceeding 65535 have 65536 subtracted until they are valid (MDN Web Docs, Basics of Javascript). This ensures that all returned characters represent valid Unicode values within the 65535 range (MDN Web Docs, String.fromCharCode() - JavaScript).

Browser compatibility is excellent, with support in all modern browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera (MDN Web Docs, String.fromCharCode() - JavaScript). The method is considered a static method of the String object, requiring the syntax "String.fromCharCode()" rather than being called on a String object instance (MDN Web Docs, Basics of Javascript).


## Browser Compatibility

The fromCharCode() method returns a string of length N consisting of the N specified UTF-16 code units and is implemented as a static method of the String object. It requires numeric values as its arguments, which can be provided in decimal or hexadecimal format. The method processes these values to convert Unicode code units into characters, with values greater than 65535 being truncated to fit within the 16-bit limit.

The method returns a string representing the characters for the provided Unicode values and operates through the syntax String.fromCharCode(), requiring the string "String" to be used as the object name. Attempting to assign the method to a different variable will result in a TypeError, as demonstrated by the following example:

```javascript

let myString = 'word';

let str = myString.fromCharCode(65, 66, 67);

console.log(str); // Output: TypeError: myString.fromCharCode is not a function

```

The method's functionality aligns with its role in JavaScript's string handling capabilities, providing developers with a straightforward way to convert Unicode values into character representations. This method serves as a fundamental tool for text manipulation and encoding in web applications, as noted in the Mozilla Developer Network documentation.
