# JavaScript Object.isSealed() Method

In JavaScript's powerful yet complex object model, maintaining data integrity while allowing controlled modifications presents a delicate balancing act. The language offers several mechanisms to protect object structures, with the `Object.isSealed()` method serving as a crucial tool in this domain. By sealing an object, developers can prevent new properties from being added and existing ones from being reconfigured, while still allowing modifications to writable property values. This article explores the nuances of JavaScript's sealing functionality, comparing it to related mechanisms like freezing, and examines its practical applications in maintaining data consistency and protecting object structures. Through detailed examination of implementation details and real-world use cases, we'll uncover how this seemingly simple method provides a robust foundation for managing complex JavaScript data structures.


## Object Sealing and Integrity

When JavaScript's `Object.isSealed()` method returns `true`, the object has undergone sealing, a process that prevents new properties from being added and existing properties from being reconfigured. This differs from freezing, another object integrity mechanism provided by JavaScript's `Object` methods.


### Sealing vs. Freezing

An object sealed using `Object.seal()` behaves similarly to a frozen object in that no new properties can be added, and existing properties cannot be deleted or reconfigured. The key distinction is that sealed objects allow modification of existing property values if they are writable, while frozen objects prevent any modifications to property values as well as property additions and deletions.


### Implementation Details

The sealing process makes an object non-extensible, meaning its `[[Extensible]]` internal property is set to `false`. This affects how the object behaves in various operations: when using `Object.keys()`, sealing has no impact on enumeration performance, while both sealing and freezing can improve enumeration performance in certain browsers like Chrome. The object itself retains its writable properties, allowing their values to be changed unless the property is explicitly marked as non-writable.


### Verification and Usage

To determine if an object is sealed, you can use `Object.isSealed(object)`, which returns `true` for objects that are sealed or frozen. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where data integrity needs to be maintained, such as protecting shared or global objects from changes. While sealing an object's prototype using `Object.seal(Object.prototype)` prevents adding new properties to objects that inherit from it, it does not affect the sealed object's own properties or those of its ancestors.

## Practical Applications of Object Sealing

The primary use cases for sealing an object center around maintaining data integrity and preventing accidental modifications. By disabling property additions and reconfigurations, developers can protect shared or global objects from unintended changes that could compromise application logic or data consistency.

Sealing provides an intermediate level of protection between immutable and modifiable objects, allowing developers to lock down an object's structure while still permitting value updates. This hybrid approach makes it particularly useful for:

1. Data structures: Objects representing constant values or metadata can be sealed to prevent accidental modifications that might affect application behavior.

2. Cached data: Sealing cached objects ensures that their contents remain consistent across operations, while allowing stored values to be updated as needed.

3. Configuration objects: Shared configuration settings can be protected from unintended changes while maintaining flexibility for value modifications.

4. Library interfaces: Publicly exposed objects in libraries or frameworks can be sealed to prevent users from modifying internal state, while still allowing documented methods to operate on the data.

The method's flexible nature, allowing property values to remain writable while preventing structure modifications, makes it suitable for scenarios where existing data needs protection while new data is still welcome. This combination of restrictions and flexibility positions Object.seal as a powerful tool for managing object-based data structures in JavaScript applications.


## Object Sealing Method Implementation

The `Object.isSealed()` method examines an object's properties to determine if it is sealed, returning `true` for objects that are sealed or frozen. An object is considered sealed when it meets three criteria: it is non-extensible, all of its properties are non-configurable, and it is not removable (though not necessarily non-writable).

The method works by checking if the object can be extended. If an object is sealed using `Object.seal()`, all properties become non-configurable, preventing additions or deletions while allowing value modifications for writable properties. This method returns `true` for sealed objects and returns `false` for non-sealed objects, including those that are extensible or have configurable properties.

When dealing with prototypes, `Object.seal(Object.prototype)` makes all objects immutable by preventing new properties from being added, while existing properties remain non-configurable. This demonstrates how sealing can impact object structure and inheritance, particularly when working with shared or global objects.

For example, attempting to add a new property to a sealed object fails silently in non-strict mode, while modifying writable properties maintains data integrity without altering the object's sealed state. The method's implementation checks if the object is an instance of `Object`, returning `true` for sealed objects and `false` for non-sealed objects, with the behavior differing between ECMAScript 5 and 2015 specifications for handling non-object arguments.


## Working with Sealed Objects

The `Object.seal()` method prevents new properties from being added to an object and marks all existing properties as non-configurable. According to MDN Web Docs and JavaScript.info, this means once sealed, properties cannot be deleted or reconfigured, though their values can still be modified if they are writable.

To check if an object is sealed, developers use the `Object.isSealed(object)` method, which returns `true` for objects marked as sealed or frozen. This implementation is based on ECMAScript 2026 Language Specification, though its behavior slightly differs between ECMAScript 5 and 2015 specifications for handling non-object arguments.

When working with sealed objects, attempts to add new properties fail silently in non-strict mode, while modifying writable properties maintains data integrity without altering the object's sealed state. This behavior holds true across major browsers, though enumeration performance may vary: Firefox shows no impact, IE demonstrates negligible changes, and Chrome optimizes sealed or frozen objects' enumeration speed.

Sealed objects maintain their writable property values while protecting structure from changes, making them suitable for scenarios requiring constant property implementation. The method's effectiveness relies on its trio of requirements: non-extensibility, non-configurability of existing properties, and non-removability. While MDN Web Docs note some factual errors, this framework provides robust guidance on managing object integrity through sealing mechanisms.
