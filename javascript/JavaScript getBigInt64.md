# JavaScript DataView: getBigInt64

JavaScript's ArrayBuffer and DataView classes enable precise binary data manipulation through direct memory access capabilities. While the language natively handles smaller integer types, support for 64-bit signed integers (BigInt) was crucial for applications requiring large numeric ranges. The getBigInt64 method fills this gap, providing developers with a robust solution for reading 64-bit integers while maintaining compatibility with both big-endian and little-endian byte orders. Understanding this method's functionality and limitations is essential for implementing efficient binary data processing in modern JavaScript applications.


## DataView and ArrayBuffer Basics

The ArrayBuffer interface serves as the foundation for JavaScript's binary data handling, allowing developers to create fixed-size blocks of memory through the ArrayBuffer() constructor, which accepts a size argument in bytes. The default size is 0, and valid sizes range from 0 to Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER.

DataViews provide essential functionality for reading and writing data in these buffers, offering methods specifically designed for number conversions, endianness handling, and modular arithmetic operations. The basic DataView operations include getting and setting values for different integer types and floating-point numbers.

To illustrate, let's consider the getUint8 method mentioned in the documentation. This method retrieves a single byte's binary data and processes it into an unsigned 8-bit integer:

```javascript

const view = new DataView(new ArrayBuffer(2));

console.log(view.getUint8(0)); // Example output: 200

console.log(view.getUint8(1)); // Example output: 30

```

These operations enable precise control over binary data manipulation, particularly important for scenarios requiring low-level memory access or cross-platform data exchange.

The DataView interface handles endianness through the littleEndian parameter in its get and set methods. For instance, when setting a uint16 value:

```javascript

const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(2);

const view = new DataView(buffer);

view.setUint16(0, 513); // Sets value at offset 0

console.log(view.getUint16(0)); // Retrieves value at offset 0

```

Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for effectively utilizing JavaScript's ArrayBuffer and DataView classes in various application contexts.


## getBigInt64 Method Overview

The getBigInt64 method retrieves a signed 64-bit integer from a DataView object at a specified byte offset.

The method accepts two parameters:

- byteOffset: The offset, in bytes, from the start of the view to read the data. This value must be within the bounds of the view.

- littleEndian: Optional parameter indicating whether the 64-bit integer is stored in little- or big-endian format. If not specified or set to false, big-endian format is assumed.

The method returns a BigInt value representing the 64-bit signed integer. The BigInt value ranges from -2^63 to 2^63-1. If the byteOffset would read beyond the end of the view, a RangeError is thrown.

The following examples demonstrate the method's functionality:

Example 1:

const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);

const dataview = new DataView(buffer);

console.log(dataview.getBigInt64(0)); // Output: 0

Example 2:

const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);

const dataview = new DataView(buffer);

const byteOffset = 0;

const value = 2n ** (64n - 1n) - 1n;

dataview.setBigInt64(byteOffset, value);

console.log(dataview.getBigInt64(byteOffset)); // Output: 9223372036854775807

Example 3 (throws RangeError):

const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);

const dataview = new DataView(buffer);

const byteOffset = 16; // Beyond the end of the view

const value = 2n ** (64n - 1n) - 1n;

try {

  dataview.setBigInt64(byteOffset, value);

  console.log(dataview.getBigInt64(byteOffset));

} catch (error) {

  console.error(error); // Output: RangeError: The byteOffset is too high

}


## getBigInt64 Method Usage

The getBigInt64 method enables precise retrieval of signed 64-bit integers from a DataView, supporting both big-endian and little-endian byte orders. Without the littleEndian parameter or when set to false/undefined, the method defaults to big-endian format, as illustrated in the official documentation.

The method's implementation demonstrates its flexibility in handling multi-byte values from any offset within the view. For instance, it successfully reads from offsets where previous 32-bit operations would not be aligned, showcasing its capability to fetch 64-bit values from non-aligned positions.

A practical example of the method's usage can be seen in setting a maximum 64-bit integer value and then retrieving it:

```javascript

const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);

const dataview = new DataView(buffer);

const max = 10000n;

dataview.setBigInt64(3, max);

console.log(dataview.getBigInt64(3)); // Output: 10000

```

This method's compatibility spans modern browsers, with support beginning in Chrome 9, Edge 12, Firefox 15, Internet Explorer 10, Opera 12.1, and Safari 5.1. The method consistently returns BigInt values within the range of -2^63 to 2^63-1, providing a robust solution for working with 64-bit signed integers in JavaScript.

The official documentation notes that while the method works across these versions, developers should be aware that older versions of Safari and Node.js lack support. This information helps developers plan cross-browser compatibility strategies when implementing DataView functionality in their projects.


## getBigInt64 Method Syntax

The getBigInt64 method in JavaScript's DataView interface reads 8 consecutive bytes from the specified offset and interprets these bytes as a signed 64-bit integer. This operation supports both big-endian and little-endian formats, though the default behavior is big-endian when the littleEndian parameter is unspecified or set to false.

The method requires two parameters for its operation:

- byteOffset: This specifies the position from which to read the data within the DataView. The value must be a non-negative integer that falls within the bounds of the view's size.

- littleEndian: An optional parameter that determines the byte order of the retrieved value. If set to true, the method reads the value in little-endian format, while false or undefined defaults to big-endian.

Upon successful execution, the method returns a BigInt value. The valid range for return values is from -2^63 to 2^63-1. If the specified byteOffset would exceed the DataView's boundaries, a RangeError is thrown to prevent out-of-bounds access.

This method provides flexibility in handling multi-byte integer values through its lack of alignment constraints. It enables retrieval of 64-bit integers from arbitrary byte offsets within a DataView, making it a powerful tool for working with binary data in JavaScript applications.


## getBigInt64 Method Specifications

The method follows a syntax of getBigInt64(byteOffset, littleEndian), where byteOffset indicates the starting position in bytes from which to read the data, and littleEndian determines whether the 64-bit integer is stored in little-or-big endian format. The big-endian format is used when littleEndian is unspecified or set to false.

The getBigInt64 method returns a BigInt value representing the 64-bit signed integer, with possible values ranging from -2^63 to 2^63-1. If the byteOffset would read beyond the end of the view, a RangeError is thrown to prevent out-of-bounds access.

Examples of usage demonstrate both default big-endian and little-endian formats. For instance, creating and setting a value within a DataView object:

```javascript

const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);

const dataview = new DataView(buffer);

// Set a value using default big-endian format

const maxValue = 10000n;

dataview.setBigInt64(3, maxValue);

console.log(dataview.getBigInt64(3)); // Output: 10000

// Explicitly set little-endian format

dataview = new DataView(buffer);

dataview.setBigInt64(3, maxValue, true);

console.log(dataview.getBigInt64(3, true)); // Output: 10000

```

Browser compatibility for the getBigInt64 method began with Chrome 9, Edge 12, Firefox 15, Internet Explorer 10, Opera 12.1, and Safari 5.1. While fully supported in modern browsers, developers should be aware that older versions of Safari and Node.js lack this functionality, requiring consideration for cross-browser compatibility strategies.
