# JavaScript Function DisplayName

JavaScript provides developers with powerful tools to manage and manipulate functions through various naming properties. While the basic `name` property returns the default function name, the `displayName` property offers more flexibility for developers working with the automation interface or React components. This article explores these naming properties in detail, comparing their implementation across different environments and use cases. Whether you're working on server-side automation or client-side React applications, understanding how to set and access these display names will enhance your debugging capabilities and code readability.


## DisplayName Function in Automation Interface

The DisplayName function in the JavaScript automation interface returns the Name Alias value of a Tag Definition as a string. It retrieves this value from a lookup table that is updated when the model is opened and when a Tag Definition is created.

The function syntax is: DisplayName("<tag definition name>") where <tag definition name> is a string specifying the Name of the Tag Definition. This allows developers to access the display name associated with each Tag Definition, making it easier to reference and manipulate data within the automation interface.

For compatibility with the browser environment, it's worth noting that while the DisplayName function is specific to the automation interface, the similar functionality provided by JavaScript's Function.displayName property has limited browser support. The property itself is non-standard and not on a standards track, with Firefox being the only browser that utilizes it for displaying names in consoles and profilers.

When working with Function.displayName in a browser context, developers should expect poor cross-browser support and compatibility issues across major engines. The property allows setting a custom display name for functions, which can be particularly useful for debugging and logging purposes, though it's important to note that the behavior and implementation details may vary between different JavaScript environments.


## Function.displayName Property

The Function.displayName property in JavaScript allows developers to set a custom display name for functions, overriding the default undefined value. This property follows specific decoding patterns when displaying names in consoles and profilers, with Firefox being the only browser that utilizes it.

When setting the displayName property, developers can use various methods:

1. Function declarations:

```javascript

var a = function() {};

a.displayName = 'My Function';

console.log(a); // "function My Function()"

```

2. Function expressions:

```javascript

var object = { someMethod: function() {} };

object.someMethod.displayName = 'someMethod';

console.log(object.someMethod.displayName); // logs "someMethod"

```

3. Dynamically in function calls:

```javascript

var object = {

  someMethod: function(value) {

    arguments.callee.displayName = 'someMethod (' + value + ')';

  }

};

console.log(object.someMethod.displayName); // "undefined"

object.someMethod('123');

console.log(object.someMethod.displayName); // "someMethod (123)"

```

The property provides several benefits for debugging and development:

- Improved stack traces in development tools

- Clearer function identification in console logs

- Enhanced component naming in React development

However, developers should be aware of the property's limitations:

- Limited browser support, with only Firefox utilizing it for consoles and profilers

- Not part of any standard and has browser compatibility issues

- Can be wiped out by code minification processes

In React development, the displayName property is particularly important for:

- Component identification in development tools

- Proper rendering of component names in JSX

- Debugging higher-order components

For class components, developers can set the displayName using the class definition:

```javascript

class MyComponent extends React.Component {

  displayName = 'HeyHey';

  render() {

    // component logic

  }

}

```

For functional components, developers can use either of these methods:

1. Using the function syntax:

```javascript

const MyComponent = (props) => {

  // component logic

}

MyComponent.displayName = 'HeyHey';

```

2. Using Object.assign:

```javascript

const MyComponent = Object.assign(

  props => {

    // component logic

  },

  { displayName: 'HeyHey' }

);

```

The `displayName` property enables developers to provide meaningful function names in development tools and debugging sessions, though its implementation requires careful consideration of browser compatibility and code minification practices.


## Setting and Accessing Function Names

The `displayName` property in JavaScript functions allows developers to set a custom display name for functions, overriding the default undefined value. This property follows specific decoding patterns when displaying names in consoles and profilers, with Firefox being the only browser that utilizes it.

Function names can be accessed using both the `displayName` and `name` properties. The `name` property returns the original function name, while `displayName` returns the custom display name set using the property. For example:

```javascript

function func1() { }

func1.displayName = "someName"

console.log(func1.displayName) // Output: someName

```

This allows developers to provide meaningful function names in development tools and debugging sessions. Setting the `displayName` property is particularly important for debugging purposes, as it can be wiped out by code minification processes.

When setting the `displayName` property, developers can use various methods:

- Function declarations:

```javascript

var a = function() {};

a.displayName = 'My Function';

console.log(a); // "function My Function()"

```

- Function expressions:

```javascript

var object = { someMethod: function() {} };

object.someMethod.displayName = 'someMethod';

console.log(object.someMethod.displayName); // logs "someMethod"

```

- Dynamically in function calls:

```javascript

var object = {

  someMethod: function(value) {

    arguments.callee.displayName = 'someMethod (' + value + ')';

  }

};

console.log(object.someMethod.displayName); // "undefined"

object.someMethod('123');

console.log(object.someMethod.displayName); // "someMethod (123)"

```

The `displayName` property enables developers to provide meaningful function names in development tools and debugging sessions, though its implementation requires careful consideration of browser compatibility and code minification practices.


## DisplayName Standards and Browser Support

As a non-standard feature, the Function.displayName property in JavaScript offers limited browser support, with Firefox being the only engine to utilize it for displaying names in consoles and profilers. The property follows specific decoding patterns when displaying names, though these patterns are only recognized by Firefox. For instance, if the display name ends with alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dollar signs, the longest such suffix is displayed. The property can also strip square brackets, trailing dots and less-than characters, and remove common patterns like parentheses and underscores before display.

Due to its non-standard status and lack of cross-browser compatibility, developers must consider alternative approaches for function and component naming in JavaScript applications. While the property allows setting a custom display name for functions through various methods including function declarations, function expressions, and dynamic assignment, its implementation details can vary between environments. The displayName may not display correctly in production builds due to code minification processes that can alter function names.

In the React framework, the displayName property is particularly important for component identification in development tools and proper rendering of component names in JSX. For functional components, developers must explicitly set the displayName property to ensure meaningful names in development tools and debugging sessions, as it is not automatically generated for arrow functions. Class components, in contrast, do not require explicit displayName setting, as React uses the class name directly. However, both class and functional components benefit from displayName setting, as this property enables clear stack traces and enhanced debugging capabilities in development environments.


## DisplayName in React and Component Development

React requires the `displayName` property for functional components defined as arrow functions. For these components, set the `displayName` using either the function syntax or `Object.assign` method:

```javascript

const SomeComponent = () => <p>I come from an arrow function</p>

SomeComponent.displayName = 'HeyHey'

```

For non-arrow function components, React uses the function's name as `displayName` without requiring explicit definition.

To access the `displayName`, use `this.constructor.displayName` when the component is mounted. For components compiled with Webpack, the `displayName` may be minified during production builds. To retrieve the original component name in code, use `this.constructor.name`.

For class components, set the `displayName` directly in the class definition:

```javascript

class MyComponent extends React.Component {

  displayName = 'HeyHey'

  render() {

    // component logic

  }

}

```

The `displayName` property enables clear stack traces and enhanced debugging capabilities in development environments. For higher-order components, first try `displayName`, then `name`, and fall back to a hardcoded string like `'Component'` or `'Anonymous'`.

The `displayName` property follows specific decoding patterns when displaying names in consoles and profilers, with Firefox being the only browser that utilizes it. The property is cleaned up before display by removing common patterns:

- Trailing `(...)` and `(...)` are removed

- Trailing `.` and `<` are removed

- Trailing `(^)` is removed

- Trailing `[]` is removed

- Trailing `_` is removed

The property returns the display name of a function when defined, returning undefined if not defined. Due to its non-standard status and lack of cross-browser compatibility, the property should be used with the understanding that it only works in Firefox and has specific implementation details that must be followed for correct display.
