# JavaScript Atomics: store Method

JavaScript's Atomics API introduces powerful capabilities for managing shared memory across multiple threads. This article focuses on the `Atomics.store()` method, which enables atomic updates to integer typed arrays within shared memory spaces. We'll explore how this fundamental operation works, its supported data types, and how it helps prevent race conditions in concurrent programming scenarios. The article also addresses implementation details, including error handling and performance considerations for building efficient multi-threaded applications.


## Atomics Overview

Atomics in JavaScript represents a significant advancement in managing shared memory across multiple threads. These primitives enable developers to implement complex concurrent algorithms while ensuring data integrity and consistency.

The Atomics module operates on shared memory spaces managed through SharedArrayBuffer, providing a foundation for multi-threaded JavaScript applications. This shared memory model allows communication between the main JavaScript thread and web-worker threads, offering a powerful mechanism for parallel processing.

Atomics includes a comprehensive suite of operations, including store, load, compareExchange, exchange, increment, and decrement. These methods provide both basic atomic operations and more sophisticated synchronization primitives, enabling developers to handle various concurrency challenges.

The primary mechanism behind Atomics is the AtomicOperations class, which uses internal locking to ensure indivisible operations. This class implements fundamental synchronization patterns such as mutexes, which guarantee mutual exclusion and prevent race conditions. The implementation uses compareExchange and wait methods to manage thread synchronization, ensuring that operations are performed in a predictable and safe manner.

A practical example demonstrates the essential role of Atomics in concurrent programming. When performing simple arithmetic operations on shared memory, using Atomics ensures consistent results across threads. Without proper synchronization, threads may produce inconsistent outputs due to unordered events. The atomic implementation consistently updates shared data, while non-atomic approaches lead to unpredictable behavior.

The Atomics module is particularly important for applications that require high performance and efficient memory management. This includes complex applications like Figma or Google Drive, performance-critical environments such as WebAssembly and WebGL, and multi-threaded Node.js modules. By providing direct access to shared memory from both JavaScript and potentially C/C++ code, Atomics enables more efficient and powerful parallelism than traditional JavaScript concurrency mechanisms.


## store Method Details

The Atomics.store() method in JavaScript enables developers to atomically update the value at a specific position in an integer typed array. This operation returns the original value that was stored before the update, ensuring that no other writes occur until the modification is complete.


### Supported Typed Arrays

The method works with several typed array types, including Int8Array, Uint8Array, Int16Array, Uint16Array, Int32Array, Uint32Array, BigInt64Array, and BigUint64Array. This flexibility allows developers to choose the appropriate data type for their specific use case while maintaining atomicity.


### Method Implementation

The Atomics.store() method follows the syntax Atomics.store(typedArray, index, value), where:

- typedArray is an integer typed array representing the shared memory location

- index specifies the position in the typedArray to store the value

- value is the number to be stored at the specified position

The method returns the original value that was stored, providing visibility into the previous state of the memory location. This return value is crucial for managing concurrent access patterns and implementing synchronization logic.


### Error Handling

The method includes several built-in checks to handle common errors:

- Throws a TypeError if the typedArray is not one of the allowed integer types

- Throws a TypeError if the typedArray is not a shared typed array

- Throws a RangeError if the index is out of bounds in the typedArray

These error conditions help prevent common programming mistakes and ensure that the shared memory remains consistent across multiple threads.


### Practical Implementation

A practical example demonstrates the method's usage with a SharedArrayBuffer and Uint8Array objects:

```javascript

let mybuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(25);

let myarray = new Uint8Array(mybuffer);

myarray[0] = 40;

console.log(Atomics.store(myarray, 0, 20)); // Output: 40

console.log(myarray[0]); // Output: 20

```

This implementation shows how Atomics.store() consistently updates shared data, ensuring that subsequent reads reflect the most recent atomic operation.


### Browser Support

As of December 2021, the Atomics.store() method is available across many devices and browser versions. However, complete support requires the use of SharedArrayBuffer, which has varying levels of implementation across browsers. As of the latest documentation, Chrome and Edge lack support, while Firefox supports it from version 55 onwards, though with a preference setting required in earlier versions.


## Method Implementation

The store operation in the Atomics module works with SharedArrayBuffer and integer typed arrays, including Int8Array, Uint8Array, Int16Array, Uint16Array, Int32Array, Uint32Array, BigInt64Array, and BigUint64Array. The method follows the syntax Atomics.store(typedArray, index, value), where:

- typedArray is an integer typed array representing the shared memory location

- index specifies the position in the typedArray to store the value

- value is the number to be stored at the specified position

The return value of this operation is the original value that was stored before the update, providing a mechanism to manage concurrent access patterns. This return value is crucial for implementing synchronization logic, as demonstrated in the following example:

```javascript

let mybuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(25);

let myarray = new Uint8Array(mybuffer);

myarray[0] = 40;

console.log(Atomics.store(myarray, 0, 20)); // Output: 40

console.log(myarray[0]); // Output: 20

```

The method throws specific exceptions to handle common errors:

- Throws a TypeError if the typedArray is not one of the allowed integer types

- Throws a TypeError if the typedArray is not a shared typed array

- Throws a RangeError if the index is out of bounds in the typedArray

These error conditions help prevent common programming mistakes and ensure that the shared memory remains consistent across multiple threads.

As of December 2021, the Atomics.store() method is available across many devices and browser versions, though full support requires SharedArrayBuffer, which has varying levels of implementation across browsers. For example, Chrome and Edge lack support, while Firefox supports it from version 55 onwards, though with a preference setting required in earlier versions.


## Exception Handling

The Atomics.store() method throws specific exceptions to handle common errors, ensuring that the shared memory remains consistent across multiple threads. The error conditions are as follows:


### TypeError

The method throws a TypeError in two scenarios:

1. If `typedArray` is not one of the allowed integer types: The method supports Int8Array, Uint8Array, Int16Array, Uint16Array, Int32Array, Uint32Array, BigInt64Array, and BigUint64Array. Any other typed array type will result in a TypeError.

2. If `typedArray` is not a shared typed array: The method requires the typed array to be a SharedArrayBuffer. Non-shared typed arrays will produce a TypeError during execution.


### RangeError

The method throws a RangeError when the `index` provided is out of bounds for the `typedArray`:

- The index must be a non-negative integer within the valid range of the typed array's length. Providing an index that is too large will result in a RangeError.


### Implementation Mechanics

The Atomics.store() method uses these error conditions to enforce type safety and prevent runtime errors related to invalid memory access. When a TypeError is thrown, it typically indicates a programming mistake in the usage of the method. The RangeError ensures that all accessed memory locations are within the valid bounds of the shared array, preventing potential security vulnerabilities or data corruption.


## Concurrent Access and Performance

The `store` method enables safe concurrent access to shared memory by performing operations atomically, meaning the operation appears as a single, non-interruptible step. This atomicity prevents race conditions that can arise from concurrent reads and writes to the same memory location.


### Non-Synchronized Reads and Compiler Optimization

The shared memory model can lead to subtle issues when combined with modern compiler optimizations. For example, a thread may continuously check a shared memory location while another thread updates it. If the reads are not properly synchronized, the checking thread may enter an infinite loop due to the compiler reordering operations.


### Increment Example

A practical demonstration of these challenges involves incrementing a shared counter:

```javascript

let counter = [0];

let mutex = [Mutex.#LOCKED];

atobeginning: while (true) {

  let old_value = Atomics.load(counter); // Read current value

  let new_value = old_value + 1; // Increment value

  if (Atomics.compareExchange(counter, old_value, new_value) !== old_value) {

    // Failed to update, retry loop

    continue atobeginning;

  }

  // Successfully updated

  old_value = Atomics.load(mutex); // Check mutex state

  if (old_value === Mutex.#LOCKED) {

    continue atobeginning;

  }

  // Critical section: safe to modify shared data

  ...

  Atomics.store(mutex, Mutex.#UNLOCKED); // Signal completion

}

```


### Atomic Operations and Overheads

While atomic operations prevent race conditions, they also introduce additional overhead compared to non-atomic operations. Methods like `Atomics.wait` can block the current thread, potentially leading to idle CPU cycles if not managed carefully.


### Best Practices

To optimize performance and ensure safety:

- Minimize the amount of shared data between threads

- Design algorithms that require fewer atomic operations

- Batch operations to reduce synchronization points


### Current Browser Support

As of the latest specifications, the `store` method requires `SharedArrayBuffer`, which has varying levels of implementation across browsers. Full support exists in Firefox (version 55 onwards), but Chrome and Edge lack implementation, requiring alternative approaches for concurrent access.


### Implementation Considerations

The method enforces specific memory ordering, blocking access during critical sections to prevent data corruption. Each atomic operation creates contention points that can degrade performance under high concurrency. Developers must carefully manage these interactions to build robust concurrent applications.
