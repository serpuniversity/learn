# JavaScript AsyncIterator and Symbol.asyncIterator

Asynchronous iteration represents a fundamental shift in how JavaScript processes collections of data, enabling developers to work with resources that generate values over time. This capability is particularly crucial for handling modern applications that frequently interact with remote data sources, network streams, or real-time events. The introduction of AsyncIterator and Symbol.asyncIterator in JavaScript extends the language's iterator protocol to support true asynchronous operations, addressing limitations of traditional synchronous iteration in scenarios where data is not immediately available.

This article explores the core concepts of async iteration, starting with a practical introduction to AsyncIterator and Symbol.asyncIterator. We'll examine how these features enable efficient processing of asynchronous data sources while maintaining compatibility with existing iteration mechanisms. The discussion will cover the implementation details of async iterators, demonstrate their usage with concrete examples, and highlight their importance in modern JavaScript development. By the end of this article, you'll understand how to effectively utilize async iteration to handle asynchronous data streams while maintaining the simplicity and power of JavaScript's iteration syntax.


## Introduction to AsyncIterator and Symbol.asyncIterator

The Symbol.asyncIterator static property in JavaScript represents the well-known symbol for asynchronous iteration, enabling objects to conform to the async iterable protocol. This protocol requires objects to implement a Symbol.asyncIterator method that returns an async iterator. The async iterator, in turn, must provide a next() method returning promises.

To make an object asynchronously iterable, it must have a Symbol.asyncIterator method that returns an object with a next() method producing values asynchronously. Every call to next() returns an object with keys done (a boolean indicating whether the iteration is complete) and value (containing the current iteration value).

User-defined async iterables can implement the Symbol.asyncIterator key to enable asynchronous iteration. For built-in JavaScript objects, the method typically returns the object itself, allowing standard iterable syntax like for await...of loops to automatically obtain the async iterator for looping.

The async iterable protocol extends the standard iterator protocol by requiring objects to implement both [Symbol.iterator] and [Symbol.asyncIterator] methods. Together, these enable efficient processing of asynchronous data sources, such as network requests or database queries. Built-in async iterators work across modern browsers, having been available since January 2020.

Developers can use async iterators with the for await...of loop to handle asynchronous data streams, while spread operators and other iteration syntaxes require objects to implement Symbol.iterator instead of Symbol.asyncIterator. This dual-protocol approach allows JavaScript to handle both synchronous and asynchronous iteration scenarios effectively.


## Asynchronous Iteration Protocol

The async iterable protocol requires an object to implement a Symbol.asyncIterator method that returns an async iterator. This iterator must provide a next() method returning promises, conforming to the async iterator protocol established by the JavaScript language.

To create a Symbol.asyncIterator implementation, objects must adhere to a specific structure. The method returns an object with a next() function that returns a promise resolving to an iterator result object with keys done (a boolean indicating whether the iteration is complete) and value (containing the current iteration value).

The implementation can take various forms, as demonstrated in numerous examples throughout the documentation. For instance, an object implementing the async iterator should allow iteration using both async and sync mechanisms:

```javascript

let range = {

  from: 1,

  to: 5,

  [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {

    return {

      current: this.from,

      last: this.to,

      async next() {

        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

        if (this.current <= this.last) {

          return { done: false, value: this.current++ };

        } else {

          return { done: true };

        }

      }

    };

  }

};

```

This implementation provides a clear structure for async iteration, allowing other parts of the application to consume the data using standard iteration syntaxes while handling the asynchronous nature of data retrieval internally.

The protocol's flexibility extends to different use cases, as shown in examples ranging from simple countdown timers to complex data processing pipelines. This adaptability makes it a powerful tool for modern JavaScript development, supporting everything from real-time data processing to efficient management of asynchronous operations.


## Built-in Async Iterables

According to MDN Web Docs, built-in JavaScript objects currently do not have the Symbol.asyncIterator key set by default. However, they can be made async iterable through the use of async generators or by implementing the Symbol.asyncIterator method directly.

Built-in support for async iteration is primarily provided through the `for await...of` loop, which requires the presence of a Symbol.asyncIterator method. For most built-in objects, this method returns the object itself, allowing standard iterable syntax to automatically obtain the async iterator for looping. This built-in support has been available across browsers since January 2020.

The async iterable protocol requires an object to have an [Symbol.asyncIterator] key, with the associated method returning an async iterator. This iterator must provide a next() method that returns promises, fulfilling to an iterator result object with keys done (a boolean) and value (the current iteration value).

Implementation examples demonstrate the flexibility of this system. For instance, the `delayedResponses` object uses a generator-like approach to produce asynchronous responses with delays:

```javascript

const delayedResponses = {

  delays: [500, 1300, 3500],

  wait(delay) {

    return new Promise((resolve) => {

      setTimeout(resolve, delay);

    });

  },

  *[Symbol.asyncIterator]() {

    for (const delay of this.delays) {

      await this.wait(delay);

      yield `Delayed response for ${delay} milliseconds`;

    }

  }

};

```

This structure enables the use of both async and sync iteration mechanisms. The `for await...of` loop automatically obtains the async iterator when present, while spread operators and other iteration syntaxes require the Symbol.iterator property instead.

The async iterable protocol extends standard iterator functionality by allowing objects to produce values asynchronously. This capability makes it particularly useful for handling data retrieval scenarios where values are obtained through network requests or other asynchronous operations.


## AsyncGenerator and Iterator Methods

`AsyncGenerator` instances inherit from the `AsyncIterator` prototype and provide methods like `next()`, `return()`, and `throw()`, enabling controlled asynchronous iteration with promises. These methods allow full control over the iteration process while ensuring correct handling of asynchronous operations.

The `next()` method returns a Promise that resolves to an iterator result object containing `value` and `done` properties. For example, an `AsyncGenerator` created with an async function returns values through its `next()` method, making it compatible with standard iteration syntax while handling asynchronous operations internally.

The `return()` method acts as if a return statement is inserted in the generator's body at the current suspended position, allowing the generator to perform any cleanup tasks when combined with a try...finally block. Similarly, the `throw()` method acts as if a throw statement is inserted at the current suspended position, informing the generator of an error condition and allowing it to handle the error or perform necessary cleanup.

To illustrate, consider the following async generator implementation:

```javascript

async function* test() {

  await Promise.resolve();

  yield "test";

}

```

This async generator provides a basic structure for asynchronous iteration, demonstrating how Promise-based yields enable controlled asynchronous processing within the generator framework.

The `AsyncIterator` prototype object, shared by all async generator function instances, includes properties like `constructor` (initially `AsyncGeneratorFunction.prototype`) and `[Symbol.toStringTag]` (initial value `"AsyncGenerator"`). This prototype structure allows for consistent behavior across async generator implementations while enabling custom functionality as needed.


## Using Async Iteration

The for await...of loop is specifically designed for asynchronous iteration, allowing efficient processing of data that becomes available over time in an asynchronous manner. It works by getting the iterable's Symbol.asyncIterator() method and calling it to get an async iterator. If no Symbol.asyncIterator() exists, it falls back to looking for a Symbol.iterator method, which returns a sync iterator. The loop then wraps every object returned from iterator methods into a resolved or rejected promise before proceeding.

The syntax consists of a variable (which receives values from the sequence on each iteration, declared with const, let, or var), an iterable (which is the source of the sequence of values), and a statement (which is executed on every iteration, allowing block statements for multiple statements). Control flow statements like break and continue can be used inside the statement to control loop execution.

The loop operates through these key steps:

1. Calls the iterable's Symbol.asyncIterator() method

2. Gets an async iterator from the method

3. If Symbol.asyncIterator() isn't present, looks for Symbol.iterator and wraps results in async iterator

4. Repeatedly calls the iterator's next() method and awaits the returned promise

5. Exits when the iterator has completed (done: true in awaited next() result)

This structure enables efficient processing of both synchronous and asynchronous collections, making it particularly useful for reading data from remote sources like databases where values become available over time in an asynchronous manner.
