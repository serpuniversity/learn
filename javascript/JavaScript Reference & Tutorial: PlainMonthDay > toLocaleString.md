# JavaScript Dates: .toLocaleString() for PlainMonthDay

JavaScript's Date handling capabilities have evolved significantly with the introduction of the Temporal library in modern browsers and Node.js environments. This article focuses on the .toLocaleString() method for Temporal.PlainMonthDay objects, detailing its implementation and behavior across different scenarios. Through an in-depth exploration of the method's parameters and performance considerations, we'll uncover how to achieve optimal date formatting while maintaining language-sensitive conventions.


## .toLocaleString() Method

The .toLocaleString() method formats a Date object based on specified locale and options. This functionality is implemented through the Intl.DateTimeFormat API when available. The method supports three parameters: dateObj (the Date object to format), locales (optional, specifying the language through a BCP 47 language tag or array of tags), and options (optional, an object for customizing formatting behavior).

The method performs its formatting based on the runtime environment's default settings if no parameters are provided, returning a string representation of the date and time according to the selected locale and options. This output considers cultural settings for language-specific date and time formatting preferences.

By default, the method normalizes components such as weekday, year, month, and day to numeric values for optimal performance. The output may vary between implementations within the same locale and may include non-breaking spaces or bidirectional control characters. Results should not be compared to hardcoded constants, as output can differ between implementations.


## Temporal.PlainMonthDay.toLocaleString() Implementation

Temporal.PlainMonthDay's toLocaleString() method returns a language-sensitive representation of the month-day combination. It requires the output locale's calendar to match the month-day's calendar and throws an exception if they don't match. This method is part of the broader JavaScript Date handling capabilities, which utilize the Intl.DateTimeFormat API when available.

The implementation specifically checks for calendar compatibility between the input month-day and the output locale's calendar. When called multiple times with the same arguments, creating an Intl.DateTimeFormat object and using its format() method is more efficient, as this approach allows caching localization strings within a constrained context.

The method accepts two parameters: locales (optional string or array of strings) and options (optional object for custom formatting). The required calendar option must specify the calendar matching the month-day's calendar. The options object can include components such as weekday, year, month, and day, with default values set to numeric for optimal performance. The method returns a string representation of the month-day according to language-specific conventions, though the output may vary between implementations and may include non-breaking spaces or bidirectional control characters. Results should not be compared to hardcoded constants, as output can differ between implementations.


## Locale and Calendar Parameters

The `locales` parameter accepts a string with a BCP 47 language tag or an array of such strings, corresponding to the `locales` parameter of the `Intl.DateTimeFormat()` constructor. This parameter specifies the language whose formatting conventions should be used. In implementations that support the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` API, this parameter exactly mirrors the constructor's behavior. When the parameter is not provided, the method uses the host's locale.

The `options` parameter is an object that adjusts the output format, corresponding to the `options` parameter of the `Intl.DateTimeFormat()` constructor. If all specified properties are undefined, the method employs the default format. This parameter has significant implications for the method's behavior, particularly when the date's calendar is not ISO 8601. In such cases, the `calendar` option must be provided and matched to the month-day's calendar. Failure to do so results in an exception being thrown, highlighting the critical importance of calendar consistency between the input month-day and the output locale.

Additional options within the `options` object include `weekday`, `year`, `month`, and `day`, with these components defaulting to `"numeric"` if not specified. The `dayPeriod` option, when provided, includes AM/PM designations in the output string. Other available options include `hour`, `minute`, `second`, and `fractionalSecondDigits`, which control the precision of time components in the output. The method's flexibility allows for generating outputs ranging from simple month-day representations to comprehensive date-time strings, all while maintaining language-sensitive formatting through proper configuration of the `options` parameter.


## Format Normalization

In implementations supporting the Intl.DateTimeFormat API, the options passed to the toLocaleString() method are normalized to ensure consistent formatting behavior. This normalization process follows the specifications outlined in the ECMA-402 standard and ensures that key date and time components default to numeric values for optimal performance.

The method accepts a flexible `options` object that allows customization of the output format. When no specific options are provided, the method defaults to displaying the `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second` components in numeric format. This default behavior streamlines performance by using minimal configuration while ensuring compatibility with a wide range of date representations.

For more specific formatting requirements, developers can utilize the `options` parameter to request particular date and time components. The available options include `weekday`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `dayPeriod`, and various time components such as `hour`, `minute`, and `second`. These options enable precise control over the output format while maintaining language-sensitive conventions through proper configuration.

When working with non-ISO 8601 calendars, the `calendar` option becomes crucial. This parameter must explicitly specify the calendar matching the input date's calendar to ensure correct formatting. Implementations that do not provide a suitable default calendar behavior throw exceptions when calendar compatibility issues arise, highlighting the importance of explicit calendar specification in multi-calendar environments.


## Performance Considerations

Each call to toLocaleString() performs a search in a database of localization strings, which can be inefficient when repeated with the same arguments. To improve performance, especially when formatting multiple date objects with shared requirements, it's more efficient to create an Intl.DateTimeFormat object and use its format() method.

When the method is called many times with the same arguments, creating an Intl.DateTimeFormat object enables caching localization strings within a constrained context, which improves future search performance. This caching mechanism is particularly beneficial when working with multiple date objects that share common formatting requirements.

The method's performance characteristics are consistent across date types, including PlainMonthDay, PlainTime, and PlainDate. This consistency means that developers can apply the same optimization strategy across all date types when working with repeated formatting operations.
