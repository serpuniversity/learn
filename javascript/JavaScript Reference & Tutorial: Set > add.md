# JavaScript Set add() Method

JavaScript Sets offer a powerful way to manage collections of unique values while preserving their order of insertion. By utilizing the add() method, developers can efficiently store and manipulate distinct elements across various data types. This comprehensive guide explores the capabilities of the add() method, from its basic usage and browser support to advanced applications and underlying implementation details.


## Introduction to JavaScript Sets

The JavaScript Set is a collection designed to store unique values, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). It maintains these values in the order they're added, making it suitable for various data management tasks where uniqueness and order preservation are important.

To create a JavaScript Set, you can pass an array to the `Set()` constructor or initialize an empty set and use the `add()` method to populate it. For example:

```javascript

const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

// or

const letters = new Set();

letters.add("a");

letters.add("b");

letters.add("c");

```

This collection type automatically ignores duplicates. When you add an element that already exists in the set, the method has no effect:

```javascript

letters.add("a"); // No change, as "a" is already present

```

The Set maintains its elements in the order they were inserted, which can be useful for operations that rely on insertion sequence:

```javascript

for (const x of letters) {

  console.log(x); // Output: "a" "b" "c", preserving insertion order

}

```

As a JavaScript object, a Set's `typeof` returns "object" and it responds positively to the `instanceof Set` test. Its support across modern browsers has been robust since June 2017, when all major browsers (Chrome 51, Edge 15, Firefox 54, Safari 10, Opera 38) began full support. Notably, Internet Explorer does not support Sets.

Under the hood, Sets use hash tables to efficiently manage their unique values, providing average constant-time performance for insertions, lookups, and deletions. Each value's identity determines its uniqueness within the set, ensuring that even objects with identical properties are treated as distinct entities.


## The Set.add() Method

The add() method is called on a Set object to insert a new element. It follows this syntax: `_set_.add(_value_)`, where `_value_` represents the value to add to the set.


### Method Behavior and Return Value

The method returns the set object with the added value, maintaining the collection's characteristic of storing unique elements. If the element with the specified value already exists in the set, the method has no effect. This behavior ensures that each value in the set is distinct:

```javascript

const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3]);

mySet.add(4); // mySet becomes Set { 1, 2, 3, 4 }

mySet.add(3); // No change, 3 is already in the set

```


### Browser Support

The add() method requires ECMAScript 6 (ES6), which was introduced in JavaScript in 2015. Modern browsers support this method: Chrome 51, Edge 15, Firefox 54, Safari 10, and Opera 38 all provide full support. Internet Explorer, however, does not implement this feature.


### Alternative Implementation

JavaScript developers have developed workarounds for adding multiple elements at once, as the standard Set prototype does not include an addAll method. Two common approaches are:


#### Prototype Extension Method

```javascript

if (!Set.prototype.addAll) {

  Set.prototype.addAll = function(items) {

    if (!Array.isArray(items)) throw new TypeError('passed item is not an array');

    for (let it of items) {

      this.add(it);

    }

    return this;

  }

}

```

This method extends the Set prototype to allow adding multiple elements in a single call.


#### Custom Function Method

```javascript

function addAll(_set, items) {

  for (let it of items) {

    _set.add(it);

  }

  return _set;

}

```

This reusable function takes a target Set and an array of items to add, implementing the same functionality.


### Example Usage

The following examples demonstrate adding various types of values to a set:

```javascript

const numberSet = new Set();

numberSet.add(5);

numberSet.add(10); // Set { 5, 10 }

const stringSet = new Set();

stringSet.add("Tutorialspoint");

stringSet.add("Tutorix"); // Set { "Tutorialspoint", "Tutorix" }

const objectSet = new Set();

const obj1 = { Firstname: "Joe" };

const obj2 = { Lastname: "Goldberg" };

objectSet.add(obj1).add(obj2); // Set { { Firstname: "Joe" }, { Lastname: "Goldberg" } }

const booleanSet = new Set();

booleanSet.add(true);

booleanSet.add(false); // Set { true, false }

```

This functionality forms the foundation for managing unique values in JavaScript, with performance optimized through internal hash table implementation.


## Adding Elements to a Set

The JavaScript Set can store various types of values, including primitive types and objects, while maintaining uniqueness. Here are examples of adding different value types using the `add()` method:


### Primitive Types

```javascript

const numberSet = new Set();

numberSet.add(5);

numberSet.add(10); // Set { 5, 10 }

const stringSet = new Set();

stringSet.add("Tutorialspoint");

stringSet.add("Tutorix"); // Set { "Tutorialspoint", "Tutorix" }

const booleanSet = new Set();

booleanSet.add(true);

booleanSet.add(false); // Set { true, false }

```


### Complex Objects

```javascript

const objectSet = new Set();

const obj1 = { Firstname: "Joe" };

const obj2 = { Lastname: "Goldberg" };

objectSet.add(obj1).add(obj2); // Set { { Firstname: "Joe" }, { Lastname: "Goldberg" } }

```

The Set maintains the order of insertion when managing these elements:

```javascript

const mixedSet = new Set();

mixedSet.add(100);

mixedSet.add({ name: "Alice" });

mixedSet.add("Text");

mixedSet.add(100); // Duplicate, ignored

console.log([...mixedSet]); // Output: [100, { name: "Alice" }, "Text"]

```


### Array Integration

While the standard Set prototype does not include an addAll method, developers have implemented workarounds. The most common approach is to extend the Set prototype or create custom functions:

**Prototype Extension Method**

```javascript

if (!Set.prototype.addAll) {

  Set.prototype.addAll = function(items) {

    if (!Array.isArray(items)) throw new TypeError('passed item is not an array');

    for (let it of items) {

      this.add(it);

    }

    return this;

  }

}

```

**Custom Function Method**

```javascript

function addAll(_set, items) {

  for (let it of items) {

    _set.add(it);

  }

  return _set;

}

```

Both methods maintain the unique value characteristic of Sets. Here's a practical example using an array of mixed values:

```javascript

let mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4]);

const additionalSet = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

mySet = new Set([...mySet, ...additionalSet]);

```

Each approach ensures that the final Set contains distinct elements in their insertion order.


## Handling Duplicates

In a JavaScript Set, each value is stored based on its identity rather than its content. This means that even if two objects have the same properties, they will be treated as distinct elements in the set, allowing both to coexist unless one duplicates the other's reference. This identity-based uniqueness ensures consistent behavior across different types of values while maintaining the set's integrity.

When attempting to add duplicate elements, the set implements this uniqueness through its internal hash table mechanism. If a value with the same properties as an existing element is added, the duplicate is ignored to maintain the set's collection of distinct values. This behavior applies to all data types, including primitive values and complex objects.

The Set's duplicate handling is particularly efficient due to its underlying hash table structure, which enables average constant-time performance for insertion operations. The "SameValueZero" algorithm defines equality for values, treating `NaN` as equal to itself and comparing other values using the `===` operator. This foundational algorithm ensures that the set maintains its unique value characteristic while providing predictable behavior for various data types.

The implementation details of the Set's internal operations include specific handling for duplicate values. When a duplicate key is encountered through the hash function, the new value is discarded in favor of the existing value, ensuring that the set only stores unique elements. This design choice, combined with the underlying hash table structure, allows the Set to maintain its key properties of uniqueness and efficient data management.


## Set Operations

The Set class extends its functionality through several methods that work in conjunction with the add() method. These operations enable comprehensive management of set contents and relationships between sets.


### Size and Content Management

The size property returns the number of elements in the set, allowing developers to quickly check its contents:

```javascript

let mySet = new Set();

mySet.add('red').add('green').add('blue');

console.log(mySet.size); // Output: 3

```

The clear() method removes all elements from the set in constant time:

```javascript

mySet.clear();

console.log(mySet.size); // Output: 0

```

The delete(value) method removes the specified element, returning true if successful and false if the element did not exist:

```javascript

mySet.add('red').add('green').add('blue');

console.log(mySet.delete('green')); // Output: true

console.log(mySet.delete('yellow')); // Output: false

```


### Set Relationships

The has(value) method checks for the presence of an element, returning true if found and false otherwise:

```javascript

mySet.add('red').add('green');

console.log(mySet.has('green')); // Output: true

console.log(mySet.has('blue')); // Output: false

```

Set operations can directly manipulate set contents:

```javascript

let setA = new Set(['red', 'green', 'blue']);

let setB = new Set(['blue', 'yellow', 'white']);

console.log([...setA.difference(setB)]); // Output: ['red', 'green']

console.log([...setA.intersection(setB)]); // Output: ['blue']

console.log(setA.isDisjointFrom(setB)); // Output: false

console.log(setA.isSubsetOf(setB)); // Output: false

console.log(setA.isSupersetOf(setB)); // Output: false

```


### Iteration and Values

The values() method returns an iterator containing all set values, providing access to the collection's contents:

```javascript

let mySet = new Set(['red', 'green', 'blue']);

for (let color of mySet.values()) {

  console.log(color); // Output: red green blue

}

```

The entries() method returns an iterator containing [value, value] pairs, allowing access to both key and value information:

```javascript

let mySet = new Set(['red', 'green', 'blue']);

for (let [key, value] of mySet.entries()) {

  console.log(key, value); // Output: red red green green blue blue

}

```

These operations provide a robust foundation for managing unique values in JavaScript, complementing the add() method's functionality.
