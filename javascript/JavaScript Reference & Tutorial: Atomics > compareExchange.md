# JavaScript Atomics compareExchange() Method

JavaScript's Atomics API provides powerful tools for managing shared data across multiple threads, but working with atomic operations can be complex. The Atomics.compareExchange() method stands out among these tools by combining atomic reads and writes with conditional logic, making it particularly useful for implementing sophisticated synchronization primitives. This article explores the method's capabilities, from its basic syntax and behavior to its practical applications in building mutexes, semaphores, and other concurrent data structures. Through carefully designed examples and implementation details, we'll examine how this operation enables efficient thread-safe programming while navigating the challenges of multi-threaded JavaScript development.


## Syntax and Basic Usage

The Atomics.compareExchange() method is designed to perform an atomic operation on a shared integer typed array. It exchanges a value at a specified position in the array only if the passed parameter matches the old value at that position, returning the previous value.


### Syntax

The general syntax for the Atomics.compareExchange() method is:

```javascript

Atomics.compareExchange(typedArray, index, expectedValue, replacementValue)

```

Where:

- `typedArray` is one of the allowed integer types: Uint8Array, Uint16Array, Int16Array, Uint32Array, Int32Array, BigInt64Array, BigUint64Array

- `index` is the position in the typedArray

- `expectedValue` is the value to check for equality

- `replacementValue` is the value to exchange


### Example Usage

The following example demonstrates setting a flag:

```javascript

let flags = new Uint8Array(1);

flags[0] = 0;

function set(flag) {

    let oldState;

    do {

        oldState = flags[0];

        flags[0] |= flag;

    } while (Atomics.compareExchange(flags, 0, oldState, flags[0]) !== oldState);

}

```

This code sets the specified flag in the `flags` array atomically.


### Return Value

The method returns the old value at the specified position in the typedArray, regardless of whether the exchange occurred. This ensures that callers can determine if the operation succeeded.


### Data Type Support

The method supports multiple integer types, including:

- 8-bit signed integers

- 16-bit signed integers

- 32-bit signed integers

- 64-bit signed integers

- 8-bit unsigned integers

- 16-bit unsigned integers

- 64-bit unsigned integers

- Double-precision floating point numbers

- Platform-specific handles or pointers (for certain implementations)


### Browser Support

Atomics.compareExchange() is available across major browsers, including:

- Google Chrome (since December 2021)

- Microsoft Edge (since December 2021)

- Firefox (since December 2021)

- Opera (since December 2021)

- Safari (since December 2021)

However, the method requires SharedArrayBuffer objects and works with specific integer types. It throws exceptions if used with unsupported data types or out-of-bounds indices.


## Comparison with Other Operations

Atomics.compareExchange() functions similarly to the System.Threading.Interlocked.CompareExchange method, performing an atomic comparison and exchange operation on specified data types. The JavaScript API provides specific implementations for different numeric data types, including short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, and floating-point values.

Unlike the simpler Atomics.exchange() method, which always attempts to swap values regardless of their current equality, compareExchange() requires the expected value parameter to match the current value before performing the exchange. This feature makes compareExchange() particularly useful for implementing complex synchronization logic and atomic flag-setting operations.

Implementation details for compareExchange() vary across data types. For 64-bit integer operations, both JavaScript and .NET provide analogous functionality through Atomics.compareExchange() and Interlocked.CompareExchange methods, respectively. However, the actual implementation may require additional logic to handle concurrent accesses correctly, particularly when dealing with non-lock-free architectures.


### Performance Considerations

The performance implications of using compareExchange() versus simpler atomic operations like load or store depend heavily on the specific use case and memory architecture. While both operations perform atomic reads and writes, compareExchange() requires an additional comparison step, potentially making it slightly slower in single-threaded scenarios. However, its superior performance in multi-threaded environments due to reduced contention makes it a valuable tool for thread-safe programming.


## Execution Flow

The Atomics.compareExchange() method operates through a series of carefully defined steps to ensure atomicity and proper synchronization. Here's a detailed breakdown of its execution flow:

First, the method performs a comparison between the expected value and the current value stored at the specified position in the typed array. This comparison operation is performed atomically, meaning it happens in a single, indivisible step without interference from other threads.

If the comparison fails (i.e., expectedValue does not match the current value), the method immediately returns the current value at that position. At this point, no modification to the array occurs, ensuring that the operation does not proceed if the condition is not met.

If the comparison succeeds (i.e., expectedValue matches the current value), the method proceeds to the exchange step. Here, it replaces the current value in the typed array with the replacement value provided by the caller. This write operation is also performed atomically to maintain data consistency.

The method then returns the original value that was in the array at the specified position before the comparison and exchange operation took place. This return value serves both to confirm that the operation was successful and to provide the previous state of the data for potential use in further processing.

Exception handling is an important aspect of the method's execution flow. If the typed array is not one of the supported integer types (Uint8Array, Uint16Array, Int16Array, Uint32Array, Int32Array, BigInt64Array, BigUint64Array), the method throws a TypeError. Similarly, if the index provided is out of bounds for the typed array, a RangeError is thrown.

In certain implementations, such as with uint ptr and float types, additional checks and error handling are required. For instance, operations involving platform-specific handles or pointers check for null references, while floating-point comparisons must account for the nuances of NaN values and floating-point representation.

The execution flow of Atomics.compareExchange() is designed to be robust and versatile across different data types and use cases. Its combination of atomic comparison and exchange operations makes it particularly effective for implementing complex synchronization logic in multi-threaded JavaScript applications.


## Use Case Scenarios

The `Atomics.compareExchange()` method enables developers to implement sophisticated synchronization primitives directly in JavaScript, making it particularly valuable for managing shared resources across multiple threads. The following scenarios demonstrate its practical application:


### Implementation of Mutexes

A common use case for compareExchange is implementing mutual exclusion locks. The technique uses a shared buffer with two integer values: one to represent the lock state and another to hold shared data. This pattern mirrors similar implementations in systems programming languages like C++.

The basic lock implementation checks whether the lock is available, attempting to acquire it atomically:

```javascript

while (Atomics.compareExchange(int32View, 0, 0, 1) !== 0) {

    Atomics.wait(int32View, 0, 1); // Wait if lock is held

}

```

To release the lock, the code simply sets the lock state back to unlocked:

```javascript

Atomics.store(int32View, 0, 0); // Unlock

Atomics.notify(int32View, 0, 1); // Notify waiting threads

```

This pattern ensures that only one thread can execute within the critical section at any time.


### Semaphore Implementation

Another critical application of compareExchange is building semaphore constructs, which control access to shared resources by maintaining a counter. The semaphore pattern uses a similar shared buffer structure:

```javascript

int32View[0] = 3; // Initial resource count

function acquire() {

    while (Atomics.sub(int32View, 0, 1) < 1) {

        Atomics.add(int32View, 0, 1); // Increment counter

        Atomics.wait(int32View, 0, 0); // Wait for available resources

    }

}

function release() {

    Atomics.add(int32View, 0, 1); // Increment counter

    Atomics.notify(int32View, 0, 1); // Notify waiting threads

}

```

This implementation allows a specified number of threads to access the shared resource simultaneously, managing access through atomic operations.


### Practical Example: Incrementing a Counter

A simple yet practical application involves safely incrementing a shared counter from multiple threads:

```javascript

SharedArrayBuffer sharedBuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(4);

Int32Array counter = new Int32Array(sharedBuffer);

counter[0] = 0;

function increment() {

    while (Atomics.compareExchange(counter, 0, 0, 1) !== 0) {

        Atomics.wait(counter, 0, 1); // Wait if counter is accessed

    }

    counter[0]++; // Safe increment

    Atomics.notify(counter, 0, 1); // Notify other threads

}

// Multiple threads call increment()

```

This example demonstrates how compareExchange can be used to safely update shared state across multiple threads, ensuring accurate synchronization and preventing race conditions.


### Considerations for Implementation

When implementing these patterns, developers must consider several key aspects:

- **Memory Ordering**: While atomic operations ensure indivisibility, developers need to account for memory ordering and visibility guarantees, particularly in multi-core architectures.

- **Concurrency Control**: Implementations must handle contention and multiple access patterns efficiently, often requiring careful management of wait queues and notification mechanisms.

- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling and retry logic are crucial for robust synchronization, especially when dealing with complex multi-threaded scenarios.

By leveraging compareExchange along with other atomic operations provided by the Atomics module, developers can build scalable and efficient multi-threaded applications in JavaScript, addressing the same concurrency challenges faced by developers in traditional systems programming environments.


## Browser Support and Implementation

Atomics.compareExchange() is widely supported across modern browsers, with implementation details that reflect its fundamental role in JavaScript's multi-threading capabilities. The method operates on shared memory through the SharedArrayBuffer object, allowing communication between the main thread and multiple web-worker threads.

Installation and setup requirements primarily involve ensuring compatibility with the following:

- SharedArrayBuffer objects, which form the basis for shared memory

- One of the supported integer types: Uint8Array, Uint16Array, Int16Array, Uint32Array, Int32Array, BigInt64Array, or BigUint64Array

- Proper indexing to avoid RangeError exceptions

The method implements a robust error handling mechanism, throwing specific exceptions for common issues:

- TypeError: When the typedArray is not one of the allowed integer types

- TypeError: When the typedArray is not a shared typed array

- RangeError: When the index is out of bounds in the typedArray

Implementation details require careful consideration of memory ordering and visibility guarantees, particularly in multi-core architectures. This includes managing contention through retry logic and ensuring proper synchronization between threads.

The JavaScript implementation draws from established patterns in systems programming, with roots in the System.Threading.Interlocked.CompareExchange method. This approach ensures compatibility with both existing JavaScript practices and emerging multi-threading standards, including those defined by the ECMAScript 2026 Language Specification.
