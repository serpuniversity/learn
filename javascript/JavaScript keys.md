# JavaScript Set keys() Method

The JavaScript Set data structure offers efficient management of unique values, maintaining insertion order through its implementation as an optimized hash table. This article explores the Set.keys() method, which returns an iterator containing the set's values in their ordered sequence. Understanding this method's functionality and comparing it to related features like Object.keys() highlights the distinct capabilities of JavaScript's collection types. The article also examines compatibility across modern browsers and the availability of polyfills for compatibility with older environments.


## What is a JavaScript Set?

The JavaScript Set is a specialized collection designed to store unique values, ensuring no duplicates can occur. This collection maintains the order of insertion, making it particularly useful for scenarios where uniqueness and ordered traversal are required.

To create a Set, you can initialize it with an array or create an empty set and populate it using the add() method, which ignores duplicate values. The set maintains its structure as an object, as demonstrated by its "object" type classification using the typeof operator and its truthy response to instanceof Set.

The Set object offers a range of methods for managing its contents, including add() for inserting values, delete() for removing elements, and has() for checking value presence. It also provides properties like size to determine the number of elements and constructor to create new instances. The internal implementation uses a hash table structure optimized for average O(1) access times, supporting efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and lookup.

The Set maintains insertion order through its iteration methods. While iterable via a for..of loop, it's important to note that Sets are not indexed directly but can be efficiently traversed in their insertion order using these iterator functions. The keys() method, as a specific property of the Set prototype, returns an iterator object that mirrors the values() method, providing consistent behavior with JavaScript maps.


## Set.keys() Method

The keys() method of the Set object returns a new iterator object containing the values of each set in the insertion order. This method is equivalent to the values() method and does not alter the original set.

The returned set iterator is an object that provides a way to iterate over the values in the set, returning them in the order they were inserted. The syntax for set.keys() is straightforward: _set_.keys(), requiring no parameters.

Since a set has no keys, the keys() method returns the same values as values(), making JavaScript sets compatible with JavaScript maps. This iterator object can be used with standard iteration methods like for..of to process the set's elements in their insertion order.


## Set vs Map

The fundamental difference between Set and Map lies in their primary functions: Sets store and manage collections of unique values, while Maps focus on key-value data storage and retrieval. This distinction influences their behavior in various operations and use cases.


### Key Features Comparison

The Set maintains a collection of unique values where each value occurs exactly once. It provides efficient methods for adding, checking, and removing values, leveraging its hash table implementation for fast operations. Sets maintain their values in insertion order through efficient internal mechanisms, making them suitable for scenarios requiring ordered traversal.

In contrast, the Map allows association of values with specific keys, providing functionality akin to dictionaries or associative arrays. This capability makes Maps particularly useful for scenarios where data needs to be indexed or retrieved based on unique identifiers. While a set can be converted to an object using Object.entries(), and an object can be converted to a map using Map(), their primary design intents differ significantly.


### Unique Capabilities and Implementation Details

Both data structures offer built-in checks for value presence through methods like has(), but their underlying implementation details diverge. Sets use the SameValueZero algorithm for key comparison, treating NaN as equal, which differentiates their behavior from regular objects where NaN comparisons typically return false. Both structures provide iteration methods (keys(), values(), entries()), but Maps enable chaining of set calls and include additional built-in iteration capabilities through their forEach method.

For developers implementing large-scale applications or managing significant data sets, understanding these foundational differences is crucial for selecting the most appropriate data structure for specific use cases. The Set's specialization in unique value management makes it particularly valuable for scenarios requiring efficient uniqueness checks and ordered collection traversal, while the Map's focus on key-value pairs provides essential capabilities for complex data association and retrieval operations.


## Set and Object.keys()

Unlike Object.keys(), which returns an array of an object's own enumerable string-keyed property names, Set.keys() returns an iterable iterator object containing the values of the set, in the order they were inserted. Both methods share similarities in their capabilities and usage patterns, particularly when working with indexed collections.


### Key Differences and Similarities

While Object.keys() requires an object argument and returns an array of strings representing the object's keys, Set.keys() operates directly on the Set object itself, returning an iterator object that contains the set's values. This design choice by the JavaScript specification enables flexible usage of Set objects in various iteration and mapping scenarios.


### Browser Support and Implementation

Both methods have strong browser support, with Object.keys() available since July 2013 across modern browsers, including Chrome 23, IE/Edge 11, Firefox 21, Safari 6, and Opera 15 (September 2012). Set.keys() follows the ECMAScript6 (ES6) specification and became widely supported in all modern browsers starting with June 2017 versions, with specific support in Chrome 51, Edge 15, Firefox 54, Safari 10, and Opera 38.


### Practical Usage

For developers working with JavaScript collections, understanding these differences enables more effective choice between Set and Object keys() based on specific use case requirements. The direct manipulation of Set values through keys() versus the string-keyed property retrieval of Object.keys() reflects the distinct design philosophies of these collection types, optimizing for different programming patterns and data manipulation needs.


## Browser Support and Polyfills

The Set.keys() method is a JavaScript ECMAScript6 (ES6) feature supported in all modern browsers since June 2017, specifically in Chrome 51, Edge 15, Firefox 54, Safari 10, and Opera 38. As a consequence of this design, it is not available in Internet Explorer.

For developers working with older browsers that lack this functionality, both core-js and es-shims provide polyfills to enable Set features in legacy environments. These libraries maintain compatibility with the original ES6 specification while ensuring consistent behavior across different implementation versions.


### Compatibility Information

The support for Set methods, including keys(), spans multiple modern browsers, with robust implementation across Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera. As these implementations adhere closely to the ECMAScript 2026 Language Specification, developers can rely on consistent behavior while leveraging these powerful collection tools.


### Alternative Methods

While Set and Map offer similar iteration capabilities through their keys() methods, developers working with older browsers have additional options for data manipulation. The set syntax, supported since July 2015, provides another way to define object properties through function bindings. However, this feature primarily affects property handling and does not directly impact the availability of Set iteration methods.

As an ES6 feature, Set has evolved to include multiple methods that enable flexible data management. The keys() method, while highly compatible, demonstrates the broader trend towards standards-based JavaScript development that these features represent.
