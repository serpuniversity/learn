# Understanding JavaScript Promises: The .then() Method

JavaScript promises have revolutionized how developers handle asynchronous operations by providing a structured way to manage success, failure, and chaining of operations. While the core `Promise` object handles the fundamental state transitions, the `.then()` method is the workhorse of promise-based programming, enabling developers to attach handlers for both successful outcomes and errors. This introduction will explore how `.then()` works, how it enables powerful promise chaining, and best practices for using this essential method in your JavaScript code.


## JavaScript Promises: A Primer

JavaScript promises represent asynchronous operations with a guaranteed final state—pending, fulfilled, or rejected. When created using the `Promise()` constructor, a promise can resolve successfully using the `resolve()` function or fail using `reject()`. Here's how it works:

```javascript

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

  if (count) {

    resolve("There is a count value.");

  } else {

    reject("There is no count value");

  }

});

```

Promises have three key attributes:

- **Pending**: The initial state, indicating the process is not complete.

- **Fulfilled**: The operation succeeded, and you can access the resolved value.

- **Rejected**: An error occurred, allowing you to catch the error using `.catch()`.

When a promise resolves, you can access the value using the `then()` method, which executes the provided callback function with the resolved value. Rejecting a promise provides information through the `.catch()` method, which executes the provided callback function with the error.

As noted in the specification, all three handlers—`.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()`—are essential for managing promise outcomes and resources:

1. `.then()` handles the resolved value and can chain subsequent operations.

2. `.catch()` manages errors, ensuring they don't break the application.

3. `.finally()` performs cleanup or code that should run regardless of the promise's outcome.

The promise system allows multiple chains, with handlers added to the job queue after all current jobs complete. The thenable interface ensures compatibility through the `.then()` method for handling fulfillment and rejection callbacks. Support extends across modern browsers: Chrome 6.0+, Edge 9.0+, Firefox 4.0+, Opera 11.1+, and Safari 5.0+.


## The .then() Method: Success and Failure Handling

The .then() method in JavaScript's Promise API allows developers to attach callbacks for handling both success and failure cases of a promise. It takes two optional parameters: a function to run when the promise is fulfilled and another function to run when the promise is rejected.

The method returns a new Promise object, which enables chaining of promise methods. This chaining capability is crucial for managing asynchronous operations, as demonstrated in the interactive demo hosted on GitHub.

When handling a resolved promise, the first callback function (the success handler) is executed with the resolved value as its argument. For a rejected promise, the second callback function (the failure handler) is invoked with the rejection reason. Both handlers can return values or throw errors, which affect the subsequent promise in the chain:

- Returning a value resolves the promise with that value.

- Returning a promise object resumes the chain with the returned promise's state.

- Throwing an error rejects the promise with the thrown value.

This behavior enables developers to handle asynchronous operations in a structured manner, as shown in the chaining example where multiple functions can be called in sequence based on the promise's outcome.

The then() method follows specific rules for its execution flow:

1. When a promise is resolved, its callback is added to the promise job queue.

2. The native then function returns a new promise labeled as promiseB.

3. The script ends with an empty call stack.

4. The host checks job queues, prioritizing Promise job queues over event queues.

5. The Promise job queue's job is executed.

6. The only registered then callback is executed.

7. The callback receives the promise's fulfilled value and returns a value or throws an error.

8. Based on the returned value, promiseB settles either fulfilled or rejected.

Developers should understand that the then() method creates a new promise that "locks in" its state based on the original promise's outcome. This means that any subsequent changes to the original promise's state won't affect the already created promise in the chain.


## Promise Chaining: Handling Multiple Asynchronous Operations

Promises enable sequential asynchronous operations through chaining, where each `.then` handler receives the result of the previous one. The implementation ensures that any subsequent operations start only after the previous operation succeeds, as demonstrated in the example where a promise resolves after 1 second and passes its result through a chain of `.then` handlers.


### Chaining Behavior

Each call to `.then` returns a new promise, different from the original. This new promise represents the completion of both the original operation and any success or failure callbacks passed to `.then`. The `.then` function supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations, making it adaptable for various use cases.


### Handling Success and Failure

Success handlers are executed with the resolved value as their argument, while failure handlers receive the rejection reason. Both types of handlers can return values, throw errors, or return promise objects that influence the chain's progression:

- Returning a value resolves the current promise with that value.

- Returning a promise object continues the chain with the returned promise's state.

- Throwing an error rejects the current promise with the thrown value.


### Practical Usage

Developers commonly use chaining for sequential operations that depend on each other. For example, loading scripts can be managed through a chain of promise callbacks:

```javascript

loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/one.js")

.then(function(script) { return loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/two.js"); })

.then(function(script) { return loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/three.js"); })

.then(function(script) { // use functions declared in scripts // to show that they indeed loaded one(); two(); three(); });

```

The method supports arrow functions for concise syntax, as shown in the simplified version:

```javascript

loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/one.js")

.then(script => loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/two.js"))

.then(script => loadScript("/article/promise-chaining/three.js"))

.then(script => { // scripts are loaded, we can use functions declared there one(); two(); three(); });

```


### Common Patterns

Chaining allows multiple operations to be grouped into a single promise sequence. The pattern supports error handling through rejection callbacks, as demonstrated in the basic usage example:

```javascript

let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);

}).then(function(result) {

  console.log("Step 1: ", result); // logs 1

  return 1 * 2; // returns a value

}).then(function(result) {

  console.log("Step 2: ", result); // logs 2

  return 2 * 2; // returns a value

}).then(function(result) {

  console.log("Step 3: ", result); // logs 4

});

```

Understanding these behaviors and patterns enables effective management of asynchronous operations through promise chaining in JavaScript applications.


## Understanding Promise Resolution and Rejection

When a promise is fulfilled, the success callback function (if provided) is executed with the resolved value as its argument. If the success handler returns a value, the following promise in the chain is fulfilled with that value. If the value is another promise, the chain waits for its resolution before proceeding. The native `then` function returns a new promise, labeled as `promiseB`, which represents the completion of both the original operation and any success callbacks.

For rejected promises, the failure callback function is invoked with the rejection reason. The behavior when returning values or throwing errors directly affects the chain's progression. A returned value resolves the current promise with that value, while a return promise continues the chain with its state. Throwing an error rejects the current promise with the thrown value.

The promise settles into one of two final states: fulfilled or rejected. Once settled, this state cannot change. The `finally` method allows performing cleanup or operations that should occur regardless of the promise's outcome. This method returns a new promise that follows the same settled state as the original, ensuring consistent handling of asynchronous operations throughout the chain.


## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

The .then() method provides two callbacks: one for handling resolved promises and another for rejected ones. It returns a new promise that represents the completion of the original operation and any success or failure callbacks. This new promise is not the same as the one returned in the callback, but it follows the same settled state as the initial promise.

When chaining promises, the callback from the previous .then() method is appended to the new promise object returned by the current .then() method. The new promise's state depends on the completion of its handler. If the handler returns a value, the new promise is fulfilled with that value. If it returns a promise object, the new promise waits for its resolution. If an error is thrown in the handler, the new promise is rejected with the thrown value.

Developers should understand that promises created through .then() "lock in" their state based on the original promise's outcome. This means that subsequent changes to the original promise's state won't affect the already created promise in the chain. The call stack remains empty when the native then function returns, and the script checks job queues, prioritizing Promise job queues over event queues.


### Error Handling and Completion

When a promise is fulfilled, the success callback function is executed with the resolved value. If the handler returns a value, the subsequent promise in the chain is fulfilled with that value. If the value is another promise, the chain waits for its resolution before proceeding. The native then function returns a new promise, labeled as promiseB, which represents the completion of both the original operation and any success callbacks.

For rejected promises, the failure callback function is invoked with the rejection reason. The behavior when returning values or throwing errors directly affects the chain's progression. A returned value resolves the current promise with that value, while a return promise continues the chain with its state. Throwing an error rejects the current promise with the thrown value. Once settled, a promise's state cannot change, and the finally method allows performing cleanup operations that should occur regardless of the promise's outcome.
