# JavaScript Date Methods: getUTCHours

JavaScript provides various methods for working with dates, including those that help manage time across different time zones. One particularly useful method is getUTCHours, which returns the hour component of a date in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). This is important for applications that need consistent time calculations regardless of local time zone settings. The method returns hours as an integer between 0 and 23, with 0 representing midnight. Understanding how to use getUTCHours correctly can help developers create more reliable and time-zone-independent applications.


## getUTCHours Method Overview

The getUTCHours method returns the hour in the specified date according to universal time. This method is particularly useful for obtaining time zone-independent hour values, making it a valuable tool for applications that need consistent time calculations across different geographical locations.

The method returns hours as an integer between 0 and 23, with 0 representing midnight. When called on a valid Date object, it returns the hour component of the date in UTC time. For example, a date representing 3:00 PM local time would return 15 when using getUTCHours, as UTC would be 6:00 PM on the same day.

The getUTCHours method follows ECMAScript1 standards and is supported across all major browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera. It provides a simple way to extract hour values that are not influenced by local time zones or daylight saving time changes.

When used with a Date object representing today's date, getUTCHours returns the current hour in UTC time. For instance, if the local time is 6:30 AM (GMT+5:30), getUTCHours would return 1, as UTC time is 5 hours and 30 minutes behind.

For applications dealing with global users, logs, or timestamps, getUTCHours helps avoid inconsistencies caused by time zone differences. However, users should be aware that this method returns values based on UTC, which may differ from the local clock time if there are errors in the user's system time settings.


## Syntax and Parameters

The method syntax for getUTCHours is dateObj.getUTCHours(), requiring a single parameter: the Date object reference from which to extract the hour value according to universal time. This method follows ECMAScript1 standards and is fully supported across major browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.

The getUTCHours method returns hours as an integer between 0 and 23, with 0 representing midnight. It operates based on Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), which is equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The method requires a valid Date object as its input and returns NaN if the input date is invalid.

The method treats two-digit year values as relative offsets, interpreting years between 0 and 99 as 1900 or 2000 depending on the implementation. For consistent results when working with years 0-99, it's recommended to use the setFullYear and getFullYear methods instead.


## Returned Value

The getUTCHours method returns an integer between 0 and 23, representing the hour of the specified date in UTC time. This value corresponds to the number of hours since midnight, with 0 indicating midnight itself. The method always returns hours based on universal time, meaning that for any given date, it provides the hour component as it would appear in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than local time.

If a Date object is created without specifying time details, getUTCHours returns 0, which represents midnight in UTC time. This behavior occurs because the method interprets unspecified times as occurring at midnight, regardless of the standard's rule that hour 0 is represented as 13 in universal time notation. This design decision ensures consistent hour values across different date representations, though it may produce unexpected results when users expect hour 0 to be 13.

The method treats two-digit year values as offsets from 1900, similar to getUTCFullYear. For example, a year value of 99 would be interpreted as 1999, while 100 would be interpreted as 2000. This interpretation applies only to years between 0 and 99 when provided as a single number. Users working with years outside this range should use setFullYear and getFullYear methods instead.


## Usage Examples

To demonstrate how getUTCHours functions with different date creation methods, consider the following examples:


### Using Date Constructor with Local Time

```javascript

var localDate = new Date();

console.log(localDate.getUTCHours()); // Current UTC hour

```

This example creates a Date object representing the current local time and retrieves the corresponding UTC hour.


### Using Date.UTC Method

```javascript

var utcDate = new Date(Date.UTC(2023, 9, 15, 14, 30, 0));

console.log(utcDate.getUTCHours()); // Outputs: 14

```

Here, Date.UTC creates a UTC date, and getUTCHours correctly identifies the hour component.


### Handling Timezone Offsets

```javascript

var localDate = new Date("2023-10-01T15:00:00");

console.log(localDate.getUTCHours()); // Consider local timezone offset

```

For dates initialized with string representations, getUTCHours accounts for any timezone differences when determining the UTC hour.


### Parsing with Timezone Information

```javascript

var localDate = new Date("2023-10-01T15:00:00 America/Los_Angeles");

console.log(localDate.getUTCHours()); // Correctly handles IANA timezone format

```

When using string representations with IANA timezone format (e.g., "America/Los_Angeles"), getUTCHours provides accurate UTC hour calculations.


### Timezone Conversion Function

The following function demonstrates converting dates between time zones while maintaining correct UTC hour values:

```javascript

function changeTimezone(date, ianatz) {

  var invdate = new Date(date.toLocaleString('en-US', { timeZone: ianatz }));

  var diff = date.getTime() - invdate.getTime();

  return new Date(date.getTime() - diff);

}

var here = new Date();

var there = changeTimezone(here, "America/Toronto");

console.log(`Here: ${here.getUTCHours()}`);

console.log(`There: ${there.getUTCHours()}`);

```

This example corrects timezone discrepancies while preserving UTC hour values through careful timestamp manipulation.
