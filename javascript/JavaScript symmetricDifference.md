# JavaScript's Set: Calculating Symmetric Difference

The JavaScript Set object offers powerful tools for working with collections of unique elements, and one of its most useful operations is calculating the symmetric difference between two sets. This article explores the fundamentals of symmetric difference, provides efficient implementations using both native Set methods and older JavaScript techniques, and demonstrates practical applications in array manipulation and object comparison. Along the way, we'll examine performance considerations, compatibility across different JavaScript environments, and how modern browser features improve upon traditional approaches to this essential set operation.


## Symmetric Difference Fundamentals

The symmetric difference operation in mathematics refers to the set of elements that are in one of two given sets, but not in their intersection (i.e., elements that are in only one of the sets). This operation is crucial in set theory and has practical applications in various programming contexts, particularly in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, implementing symmetric difference typically involves these key steps:

1. Convert the input arrays to Set objects to eliminate duplicates and facilitate efficient comparison.

2. Use Array.prototype.filter() to create new arrays containing elements present in one set but not the other.

3. Combine the resulting arrays to produce the symmetric difference.

Most modern JavaScript implementations use a combination of Set objects and Array.prototype.filter() to achieve this. For example, one common approach is:

```javascript

const symmetricDifference = (a, b) => {

  const sA = new Set(a), sB = new Set(b);

  return [...a.filter(x => !sB.has(x)), ...b.filter(x => !sA.has(x))];

};

```

This implementation creates two Sets from the input arrays, then filters each Set to keep elements not present in the other Set. The spread operator is used to combine the filtered results into the final symmetric difference array.

The symmetric difference operation is supported directly in latest versions of Safari, Chrome, and Edge browsers through the Set.prototype.symmetricDifference() method, which provides a straightforward way to perform this operation without manual implementation. However, browser support for native symmetric difference functionality has only recently improved, with official implementation beginning in June 2024.


## Implementing Symmetric Difference

The most common JavaScript implementations of symmetric difference rely on the Array.prototype.filter() method in combination with Set objects. A typical implementation follows this pattern:

```javascript

const symmetricDifference = (a, b) => {

  const sA = new Set(a), sB = new Set(b);

  return [...a.filter(x => !sB.has(x)), ...b.filter(x => !sA.has(x))];

};

```

This approach works across modern browsers, combining the efficiency of Set operations with the concise syntax of filter(). The implementation creates two Sets from the input arrays, then filters each to keep elements not present in the other Set. The spread operator combines the resulting arrays into the final symmetric difference.

For developers targeting all browsers, including older versions of Internet Explorer, a common alternative uses the includes() method:

```javascript

const symmetricDifference = (a, b) => {

  return [...a.filter(x => !b.includes(x)), ...b.filter(x => !a.includes(x))];

};

```

This approach is slightly less efficient than Set-based methods for large arrays due to the time complexity of includes(), which is O(|B|) compared to the O(1) time complexity of has() in Set objects. However, the difference becomes negligible for small to medium-sized arrays.

The JavaScript `Set` function has evolved significantly since its introduction in ES2015. As of June 2024, all major browsers support the `Set.prototype.symmetricDifference()` method, which provides a straightforward way to perform this operation without manual implementation. This native support means that developers can now rely on these built-in functions for symmetric difference calculations.


## Performance Considerations

The performance of symmetric difference operations in JavaScript is highly dependent on the implementation technique used. Two common approaches are through native Set methods and using object maps.

The native Set API provides an efficient implementation with the `difference()` method:

```javascript

const symmetricDifference = (a, b) => {

  const sA = new Set(a), sB = new Set(b);

  return new Set([...sA].filter(x => !sB.has(x)).concat([...sB].filter(x => !sA.has(x))));

};

```

This implementation leverages the optimized internal hash functions of Sets, making `has` operations significantly faster than alternatives like `indexOf`.

An alternative approach uses an object map:

```javascript

function setMinus(A, B) {

  var map = {}, C = [];

  for(var i = B.length; i--; ) map[B[i].toSource()] = null; // any other value would do

  for(var i = A.length; i--; ) {

    if(!map.hasOwnProperty(A[i].toSource())) C.push(A[i]);

  }

  return C;

}

```

This method uses `toSource()` to generate unique property names, which can be optimized further if all elements already have unique string representations.

Performance varies based on input type. For non-DOM elements, native Set methods generally outperform object maps due to faster hash-based lookups. However, for complex objects or DOM elements, the object map approach may be more efficient due to optimized `indexOf` implementations in modern browsers.


### Method Comparison

The official TC39 proposal adds several new set methods:

- `intersection()`: Returns a new set with elements in both sets

- `union()`: Returns a new set with all elements from both sets

- `difference()`: Returns a new set with elements in the first set but not the second

- `symmetricDifference()`: Returns a new set with elements in either set but not both

These native methods provide the most efficient implementation across modern browsers, with performance improvements over manual implementations. As of June 2024, all major browsers support these methods, including:

- Desktop: Chrome 122, Edge 122, Firefox 127, Opera 108, Safari 17

- Mobile: Chrome Android 122, Firefox for Android 127, Opera Android 81

- Server: Deno 1.42, Node.js 22.0.0

The new Set methods offer enhanced functionality while maintaining efficient performance through optimized implementation. Developers are encouraged to use these built-in functions for symmetric difference calculations, providing both simplicity and efficiency.


## Language Support

As of June 11, 2024, multiple modern JavaScript engines and platforms support the `symmetricDifference` method for Set objects, providing a straightforward way to perform this operation without manual implementation. Supported platforms include:


### Desktop Browsers

- Chrome 122 (2024-02-20)

- Edge 122 (2024-02-23)

- Firefox 127 (2024-06-11)

- Opera 108 (2024-03-05)

- Safari 17 (2023-09-18)


### Mobile Browsers

- Chrome Android 122 (2024-02-20)

- Firefox for Android 127 (2024-06-11)

- Opera Android 81 (2024-03-14)

- Safari on iOS 17 (2023-09-18)

- Samsung Internet (supports native Set methods)


### Server Environments

- Deno 1.42 (2024-03-28)

- Node.js 22.0.0 (2024-04-25)

The method works by creating a Set from each input, then using `Array.prototype.filter()` to retain values present in only one of the Sets. For browser compatibility with older versions, developers can use Lodash's `_.xor()` function, which handles more than two arrays while maintaining original element order.

For environments supporting only ES5, a plain JavaScript implementation remains effective and efficient for smaller datasets. More complex use cases involving multiple array inputs can leverage Lodash for enhanced functionality and performance, especially when targeting older browser versions or environments with limited native ES6 support.


## Use Cases

The concept of symmetric difference finds practical application in various JavaScript development scenarios, particularly where set operations need to be performed efficiently. For example, the LabEx curriculum demonstrates how to implement a `symmetricDifferenceBy()` function that applies a provided function to each element before performing the calculation. This approach is useful for comparing arrays of objects based on specific properties, as shown in the following implementation:

```javascript

function symmetricDifferenceBy(arr, val, fn) {

  const setA = new Set(arr.map(fn)), setB = new Set(val.map(fn));

  return [...arr.filter(x => !setB.has(fn(x))), ...val.filter(x => !setA.has(fn(x)))];

}

```

This function first creates Sets from the arrays after applying the provided function, then filters the original arrays to retain only values not found in the other Set. The example usage provided in the documentation demonstrates how to compute the symmetric difference based on integer rounding:

```javascript

symmetricDifferenceBy([2.1, 1.2], [2.3, 3.4], Math.floor); // [1.2, 3.4]

symmetricDifferenceBy([{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }], [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 4 }], (i) => i.id); // [{ id: 3 }, { id: 4 }]

```

In addition to these specialized implementations, the freeCodeCamp challenge guide presents two effective approaches for handling symmetric difference calculations. The first solution utilizes the `unique()` function to filter arrays and concatenate the results, while the second employs a more direct comparison approach:

```javascript

function unique(value, index, self) {

  return self.indexOf(value) === index;

}

function sym(...args) {

  const arr = args.reduce((accum, item) => {

    item = item.filter(unique);

    const newAccum = accum.filter(element => !item.includes(element));

    const newAccum2 = item.filter(element => !accum.includes(element));

    return newAccum.concat(newAccum2);

  }, []);

  return arr;

}

```

These solutions demonstrate the versatility of JavaScript in handling complex set operations, with built-in methods and array manipulation techniques combining to provide both simplicity and efficiency. Modern JavaScript engines further enhance this functionality through native Set methods, making symmetric difference calculations more straightforward and performant.
