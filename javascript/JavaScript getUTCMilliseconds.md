# JavaScript Date getUTCMilliseconds Method

JavaScript's Date object provides numerous methods for working with dates and times, including functions for extracting specific components of a date. This article focuses on the getUTCMilliseconds method, which retrieves the milliseconds portion of a date according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Through detailed explanations and practical examples, we'll explore how this method operates, its behavior with valid and invalid inputs, and why it's essential for precise time calculations across different time zones.


## Method Overview

The getUTCMilliseconds() method returns the milliseconds component of a date object according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This method retrieves the millisecond value according to universal time from a given Date object, returning an integer between 0 and 999.

The method's syntax is _Date_.getUTCMilliseconds(), and it accepts no parameters. When called on a Date object created with a millisecond value outside the range [0,999], the method returns 0 as an exception. For example, creating a Date object with "October 13, 1996 05:35:32:1003 GMT+11:00" would return 0 milliseconds.

Browser support for this method is extensive, with full compatibility across major browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera, as documented since ECMAScript1 release. The method works independently of the local time zone, providing a consistent representation of time regardless of the user's geographical location.

The getUTCMilliseconds() method plays a crucial role in date and time manipulation within JavaScript, particularly when working with time zones and international date formats. It complements other UTC-related methods such as getUTCHours(), getUTCMinutes(), and getUTCSeconds() to provide a comprehensive set of tools for handling universal time.

The method's output is essential for precise time calculations and synchronization across different time zones. It returns values in UTC time, making it particularly useful in applications that require accurate timekeeping, such as financial systems, scientific research, and global communication platforms.


## Method Syntax and Parameters

The method operates on a valid Date object created using the Date() constructor. When working with invalid date formats, the method returns `NaN`. For instance, creating a Date object with "October 13, 1996 05:35:32:1003 GMT+11:00" results in 0 milliseconds being returned due to an invalid millisecond value.

The method's implementation across browsers maintains consistent behavior, returning the millisecond value according to universal time rather than local time. This distinction is crucial when comparing dates across different time zones or when working with time-based calculations that require precise millisecond accuracy.

The method is particularly useful when working with time zones that observe daylight saving time, as it provides a standardized way to extract millisecond values that is not affected by local time adjustments. For example, attempting to retrieve the milliseconds from a date string like "2017-11-15 16:53:10.78" returns 78 milliseconds, demonstrating its utility in precise time calculations.


## Return Value

The getUTCMilliseconds() method returns a numeric value between 0 and 999, representing the milliseconds portion of the date object's value. This method provides the millisecond component of a date object according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), making it essential for precise time calculations and cross-timezone applications.

For example, creating a Date object with "October 13, 1996 05:35:32:1003 GMT+11:00" would result in 0 milliseconds due to an invalid millisecond value, while "2017-11-15 16:53:10.78" returns 78 milliseconds, demonstrating its utility in accurate time calculations.

The method works consistently across major browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera, as supported since ECMAScript1 release. It functions independently of local time zones, ensuring consistent time representation globally. This functionality is crucial for applications requiring precise millisecond accuracy, such as financial systems, scientific research, and global communication platforms.


## Usage Examples

The getUTCMilliseconds() method demonstrates several patterns of usage through its integration with the broader JavaScript Date object functionality. When working with current dates, developers can leverage this method to retrieve precise millisecond values without explicit instantiation:

```javascript

const currentDate = new Date();

const utcMilliseconds = currentDate.getUTCMilliseconds();

console.log(`Current UTC Milliseconds: ${utcMilliseconds}`);

```

This approach consistently returns values within the expected range of 0 to 999, as demonstrated by the following example with a specific date:

```javascript

const specificDate = new Date(1996, 9, 13, 5, 35, 32, 1003);

const utcMilliseconds = specificDate.getUTCMilliseconds();

console.log(`Specific Date UTC Milliseconds: ${utcMilliseconds}`);

```

The method's behavior with invalid inputs follows consistent cross-browser patterns:

```javascript

const invalidDate = new Date(1996, 11, 13, 5, 35, 32, 1003); // Invalid millisecond value

const validDate = new Date(1996, 10, 13, 5, 35, 32); // Correctly formatted

console.log(`Invalid Date: ${invalidDate.getUTCMilliseconds()}`); // Output: 0

console.log(`Valid Date: ${validDate.getUTCMilliseconds()}`); // Output: 320

```

These examples illustrate the method's core functionality and its consistent behavior across valid and invalid date formats, making it a reliable tool for time-related calculations and cross-browser compatibility.


## Technical Details

The getUTCMilliseconds() method returns the milliseconds (from 0 to 999) of the specified date and time according to universal time. The method operates under the assumption that the date object is of local time, and it calculates its date accordingly.

The method specifically returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 in the UTC time zone. It complements other UTC-based methods that provide hour, minute, and second portions, and it functions independently of the local time zone.

The implementation of getUTCMilliseconds() follows the behavior defined in ECMAScript 1. Browser compatibility spans major versions including Chrome 1+, Edge 12+, Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 4+, Opera 4+, and Safari 1+. The method consistently returns values within the expected range of 0 to 999 across supported browsers, making it a reliable tool for precise time calculations and cross-browser applications.
