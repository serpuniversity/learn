# JavaScript BigInt: toString Method

The JavaScript language has evolved significantly in recent years, particularly in its handling of large integer values. With the introduction of the BigInt data type in ECMAScript 2020, developers now have access to precise integer representation for values larger than 2^53. This article explores a crucial method associated with the BigInt type: toString(). Specifically, we examine how this method converts BigInt values into string representations, including its behavior with different radix parameters and its treatment of negative values. Through a detailed analysis of the method's implementation and functionality, we uncover how JavaScript maintains consistency in integer representation across various conversion scenarios.


## BigInt.toString() Method Overview

The toString() method converts a BigInt value to a string representation, utilizing an optional radix parameter that determines the base for the conversion. When no radix is specified, the method defaults to base 10. The method ensures that negative BigInt values retain their sign during conversion, with the resulting string representing the positive binary form preceded by a '-' sign when the radix is 2.

The implementation uses the ToObject abstract operation to process the BigInt value, setting the [[BigIntData]] internal slot and returning the string representation. The radix parameter must be an integer between 2 and 36, with values outside this range resulting in a RangeError.

The method's behavior aligns with JavaScript's numeric handling capabilities, converting numbers to their string representations using the specified radix. This functionality enables precise integer representation and processing in modern JavaScript environments, with browser support beginning in September 2020.


## Radix Parameter and Base Conversion

The radix parameter is an integer between 2 and 36, specifying the base for the conversion. When no radix is provided, the method defaults to base 10. The implementation uses the ToInteger abstract operation to validate and convert the radix parameter, throwing a RangeError for values outside the supported range.

For radixes between 2 and 36, the method returns a string representation of the BigInt value using the specified base. Letters a-f represent digits 10-15, with values above 9. When the radix is 2, negative BigInt values return the positive binary representation preceded by a '-' sign, preserving the sign during conversion.

The implementation follows ECMAScript specifications, with equivalent functionality in TypedArray, DataView, and SharedArrayBuffer through BigInt64Array and BigUint64Array. The StringToBigInt function handles string inputs, while ToBigInt and ToBigInt64 abstract operations convert various value types to BigInt values.

The method's behavior aligns with JavaScript's numeric handling capabilities, converting numbers to their string representations using the specified radix. This functionality enables precise integer representation and processing in modern JavaScript environments, with browser support beginning in September 2020.


## Handling Negative BigInt Values

For negative BigInt values, the toString() method returns the positive binary representation preceded by a '-' sign, preserving the sign during base conversions (1). The negative sign is not represented as two's complement, maintaining consistency with ECMAScript specifications (2).

The implementation follows a structured algorithm: if the BigInt value is negative, it returns the string concatenation of the string '-' and the positive binary representation of the absolute value of the BigInt (3). This behavior ensures that negative values retain their sign information across different radix conversions, allowing developers to explicitly track negative values even when working with positive binary representations (4).

The method's handling of negative values distinguishes it from JavaScript's Number type, which represents negative-zero values as distinct from positive-zero, though BigInt values always evaluate to zero in boolean contexts (5). This consistent representation of negative values enables precise integer handling and comparison operations in JavaScript environments supporting BigInt functionality (6).


## BigInt.toString() Method Implementation

The `ToString()` method of `BigInt` values returns a string representation of the specified `BigInt` value, utilizing the `ToObject` abstract operation. This operation sets the `[[BigIntData]]` internal slot to the argument, facilitating precise integer handling.

For negative BigInt values, the method returns the string concatenation of the string '-' and the positive binary representation of the absolute value of the BigInt (1). This structured algorithm ensures that negative values retain their sign information across different radix conversions, enabling developers to explicitly track negative values even when working with positive binary representations (3).

When converting numbers to strings, the `thisBigIntValue` abstract operation determines the BigInt value of an object. If the object contains a `[[BigIntData]]` internal slot, the method returns that value. Otherwise, it throws a TypeError (6). The conversion process requires the radix parameter to be an integer between 2 and 36; values outside this range result in a RangeError (2).

The conversion algorithm follows specific rules for different radix values. For radixes between 2 and 36, the method returns a string representation of the BigInt value using the specified base, with letters a-f representing digits 10-15 (7). When the radix is 2, negative BigInt values return the positive binary representation preceded by a '-' sign, preserving the sign during conversion (4).

The implementation details align with ECMAScript specifications and provide consistent representation of negative values across modern JavaScript environments supporting BigInt functionality (5). This precise integer handling enables developers to work with large integers while maintaining expected mathematical properties and comparison operations (6).


## Supported Browsers and Usage Recommendations

BigInt.toString() works seamlessly in modern browsers and Node.js versions, with support beginning in Chrome 67, Edge 79, Firefox 68, Safari 14, and corresponding versions of Node.js (1). The method returns a string representation of the specified BigInt value, utilizing an optional radix parameter that determines the base for the conversion.

When converting numbers to strings, the method throws a TypeError for non-BigInt values without attempting to coerce them. The method requires its this value to be a BigInt primitive or wrapper object, converting strings by parsing as integer literals and numbers by throwing a TypeError to prevent precision loss (1).

For radixes above 10, the method uses letters of the alphabet to indicate digits greater than 9. The toString() method preserves the sign of negative BigInt values, including when the radix is 2, returning the positive binary representation preceded by a '-' sign. The method throws a RangeError if the radix is less than 2 or greater than 36, ensuring robust handling of conversion parameters (2).

Developers working with large integers should note that coercion between Number and BigInt can lead to precision loss, making BigInt suitable only for values greater than 2^53 when expected (3). The method's behavior aligns with JavaScript's numeric handling capabilities, enabling precise integer representation and processing in modern JavaScript environments (4).
