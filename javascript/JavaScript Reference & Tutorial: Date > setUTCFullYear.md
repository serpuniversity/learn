# setUTCFullYear Method in JavaScript

JavaScript's Date object provides powerful methods for manipulating dates, and setUTCFullYear stands out as a crucial tool for changing the year component while maintaining correct month and day values according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This article examines the setUTCFullYear method's functionality, from its basic usage and parameter requirements to its sophisticated handling of out-of-range values and its consistent implementation across major browsers.


## setUTCFullYear Overview

The setUTCFullYear method of JavaScript's Date object changes the year according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The primary use case is to adjust the year component of a given date while maintaining the month and day components in UTC time.

The method accepts three parameters: yearValue (required), monthValue (optional), and dateValue (optional). Notably, JavaScript's Date object represents months as integers from 0 to 11, where 0 corresponds to January and 11 to December. Therefore, the method automatically increments the year and adjusts the month when a value of 12 or greater is provided for monthValue.

When either monthValue or dateValue is outside their valid ranges, setUTCFullYear adjusts these parameters and corresponding date information accordingly. For example, trying to set the 15th month results in JavaScript internally changing the year value and resetting the month to 3 (April).

The method returns the updated Date object's timestamp, representing the difference in milliseconds from the updated date/time and January 1, 1970, 00:00:00:00 UTC. This functionality allows developers to manipulate dates consistently across different time zones and system configurations, as it operates exclusively with UTC time.


## Basic Usage

The method requires the yearValue parameter and optionally accepts monthValue and dateValue. JavaScript's Date object represents months as integers from 0 to 11, where 0 corresponds to January and 11 to December. Therefore, the method automatically increments the year and adjusts the month when a value of 12 or greater is provided for monthValue.

When either monthValue or dateValue is outside their valid ranges, setUTCFullYear adjusts these parameters and corresponding date information accordingly. For example, trying to set the 15th month results in JavaScript internally changing the year value and resetting the month to 3 (April).

The method returns the updated Date object's timestamp, representing the difference in milliseconds from the updated date/time and January 1, 1970, 00:00:00:00 UTC. This functionality allows developers to manipulate dates consistently across different time zones and system configurations, as it operates exclusively with UTC time.

Examples of basic usage include setting a date six months ago, setting a specific year, and adjusting the year while maintaining the month and day components. The implementation has demonstrated consistent behavior across different scenarios, automatically handling month and day adjustments as needed.


## Parameter Details

yearValue is an integer representing the year, with negative values allowed. monthValue is an optional integer between 0 and 11, where 0 corresponds to January and 11 to December. dateValue is also optional and represents the day of the month as an integer between 1 and 31, though it must be specified if monthValue is provided.

The method uses an absolute number for years between 1000 and 9999, returning a four-digit number. For dates between these years, getUTCFullYear returns a 4-digit integer, for example, 1995. Invalid dates result in a return value of NaN. The method attempts to handle invalid month and day values by adjusting the date information accordingly.

If monthValue and dateValue are not specified, getUTCMonth() and getUTCDate() values are used. For example, setting monthValue to 12 results in the year being incremented by 1 (yearValue + 1) and monthValue set to 3 (April). The same applies if dateValue is between 32 and 44, as this falls within the range of the next month. The method returns the updated Date object's timestamp, representing the difference in milliseconds from the updated date/time and January 1, 1970, 00:00:00:00 UTC. This functionality allows developers to manipulate dates consistently across different time zones and system configurations, as it operates exclusively with UTC time.


## Handling Out-of-Range Values

The method adjusts parameter values and date information if specified values fall outside expected ranges. The logic operates similarly for both the setUTCFullYear method and its local time counterpart, setFullYear, with all parameters expected to be integers.

For the yearValue parameter, JavaScript allows both positive and negative integer inputs, with values between 1000 and 9999 represented as absolute numbers. For example, setting yearValue to 2024 results in the year component of the date object being set to 2024.

monthValue and dateValue parameters have specific range requirements that affect how the method updates the Date object. monthValue must be an integer between 0 and 11, where 0 represents January and 11 represents December. If monthValue is outside this range, the method adjusts the yearValue accordingly. For instance, specifying 12 sets the month to 3 (April) and increments the yearValue by 1.

Similarly, dateValue must be an integer between 1 and 31, inclusive. If dateValue exceeds this range, the method updates monthValue and dateValue to valid values. For example, setting dateValue to 32 results in the monthValue being incremented by 1 (if within range) and dateValue being set to 1 of the next month.

All three parameters can be provided together, or monthValue and dateValue can be omitted to use the current values from getUTCMonth() and getUTCDate(). The method returns the updated Date object's timestamp, which represents the difference in milliseconds from the updated date/time and January 1, 1970, 00:00:00:00 UTC.

JavaScript's Date object handles out-of-range values by attempting to maintain valid date information. If an invalid date value is passed, the date will be set to "Invalid Date" and NaN is returned. For instance, passing "dfbgf" as the year results in NaN being returned.

The method's handling of invalid parameters ensures consistent date manipulation across different time zones and system configurations, as it operates exclusively with UTC time. This approach allows developers to safely adjust date information while maintaining consistent behavior across various temporal inputs.


## Browser Support

setUTCFullYear is supported across major browsers, with implementation details available for developers. The method has been available since ECMAScript1 (JavaScript 1997) and maintains consistent behavior across different time zones and system configurations by operating exclusively with UTC time.

The method's support spans all modern browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera. Implementation details show compatibility across various devices and browser versions, with documented support beginning July 2015.

Developers can reliably use the method to change the year of a Date object according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) while maintaining consistent date manipulation. The method's behavior has been standardized across JavaScript implementations, ensuring dependable year adjustments regardless of geographical location or local system settings.
