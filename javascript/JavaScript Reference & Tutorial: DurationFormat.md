# JavaScript Duration Formatting and Calculation

Working with time durations in JavaScript can be complex due to the intricacies of calendars, time zones, and fractional units. The DurationFormat library simplifies these challenges through powerful features for calculation, formatting, and manipulation of time durations. This article explores the library's capabilities, from basic operations to advanced customizations, helping developers work confidently with time durations in their applications.


## Duration Calculation Features

The DurationFormat library in JavaScript offers precise control over duration calculations through a series of detailed features:

Rounding and Unit Conversion

The library enables rounding durations to the nearest unit, the largest unit, or specific increments. Users can choose from several rounding modes including trunc, ceil, floor, and half variants (inclusive of bankers' rounding).

Normalization

Durations can be normalized relative to a specific date, with options to handle time zone and daylight saving time adjustments. The library supports conversions between ZonedDateTime and PlainDate, ensuring accurate calculations across time zones.

Temporal Unit Operations

Duration operations include converting durations to and from ISO 8601 strings, calculating total units, comparing durations, and creating new durations from existing values or temporal objects.

The library supports a comprehensive set of temporal units, including both basic units (day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, nanosecond) and derived units (year, month, week). For more complex calculations involving years, months, or weeks, the library requires a reference point (relativeTo), which defaults to 24-hour days unless specified as a PlainDate or ZonedDateTime.

The library's total method calculates the total number of units in a duration, providing flexibility in how results are represented. The implementation handles both evenly and non-evenly divisible durations, including complex cases where calendar operations are required to convert days to months or weeks.


## Rounding and Normalization

The DurationFormat library provides comprehensive tools for rounding and normalizing durations while maintaining their equivalent value through complex calculations:

Rounding Modes

The library supports multiple rounding modes controlled by the `roundingMode` option. These include standard mathematical approaches like 'ceil', 'floor', and 'halfExpand', as well as specialized implementations such as 'halfEven', which rounds to the nearest even multiple of the roundingIncrement.

The `smallestUnit` and `roundingIncrement` options work together to determine the rounding precision. Valid rounding increments for minute-based calculations include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30 minutes, while the smallestUnit can be set to 'second', 'millisecond', 'microsecond', or 'nanosecond' depending on the desired precision.

Normalization

Durations can be normalized relative to a specific date, which requires the `relativeTo` option for calculations involving years, months, or weeks. The library supports conversion between ZonedDateTime and PlainDate, ensuring accurate results across time zones and handling daylight saving time adjustments.

Additional duration operations include subtraction using arithmetic relative to a start date, negation that returns a copy of the duration with the opposite sign, and absolute value calculations that return a new duration representing the positive equivalent. These capabilities ensure precise control over duration calculations while maintaining the overall duration's value and balance.


## ISO 8601 Conversion

The DurationFormat library in JavaScript offers robust functionality for ISO 8601 duration conversion through several key methods:

Creating and Parsing ISO 8601 Durations

The library provides static methods for creating durations from various input types, including other Duration objects, plain JavaScript objects containing temporal units, and string representations of durations. This versatility allows for seamless conversion between different data formats while maintaining the integrity of the duration values.

String Conversion and Serialization

Durations can be easily converted to and from ISO 8601 string format using the library's methods. The conversion handles both simple and complex duration representations, including those with time zone information and fractional values. The library ensures accurate parsing and serialization, preserving subsecond components and handling daylight saving time adjustments as needed.

Customization and Flexibility

The duration conversion process supports multiple options for customization, including handling of time zone information and daylight saving time adjustments. This flexibility allows developers to work with durations in various temporal contexts while maintaining accurate calculations across different time zones and calendar systems.


## User Interface Customization

The `Intl.DurationFormat` API allows for highly customizable formatting of duration values through several key options. The basic usage format takes a duration object and returns a human-readable string representation. Advanced features enable precise control over numeric and unit presentation through multiple configuration properties.

The API supports various display styles for different time units. For example, the hours style can be set to "long", "short", "narrow", "2-digit", or "numeric", while the minutes display preference offers options for auto or always visibility. Numeric styles for milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds provide flexibility in how fractions of seconds are represented.

Customization extends to separator values, with options for hour-minute and minute-second delimiters. The fractional digits property controls the number of decimal places shown for numeric styles, allowing developers to balance precision with readability according to their application requirements.


## Duration Property Operations

The DurationFormat library provides a rich set of operations for manipulating durations, including methods for total value calculation, comparison, and duration creation from various temporal objects.


### Duration Property Methods

The library includes several methods for extracting and manipulating duration properties:

- `total(units, relativeTo)`: Calculates the total number of specified units in the duration. The `units` parameter can be a string or object representing the desired unit, and `relativeTo` specifies the reference point for year, month, or week calculations (defaulting to 24-hour days unless specified as a `Temporal.PlainDate` or `Temporal.ZonedDateTime`).

- `abs()`: Returns a copy of the duration with a positive length, effectively removing any negative sign.

- `negated()`: Returns a new duration object with the opposite sign of the original duration.

- `round(smallestUnit, largestUnit)`: Returns a new duration object rounded to the specified smallest unit and balanced to the largest unit. This method handles both top-heavy and standard rounding modes.


### Duration Operations

The library supports comprehensive operations for duration arithmetic:

- `addTo(temporal)`: Adds the duration to a specified temporal object, returning a new object of the same type with the adjustment. This method only adds non-zero amounts and uses seconds and nanoseconds.

- `subtract(otherDuration)`: Returns a new duration object representing the difference between the current duration and another duration. This is equivalent to adding the negated value of the other duration.

- `compare(otherDuration)`: Compares the current duration to another duration based on total length, returning a comparator value (negative if less, positive if greater).

- `dividedBy(divisor)`: Returns a new duration object representing the division of the current duration by a specified value using floating point arithmetic. This method expects potential floating point rounding errors.


### Conversion and Parsing

The library supports conversion between duration objects and various input types:

- `from(temporalAmount)`: Initializes a new duration object from an instance of `TemporalAmount`.

- `from(amount, unit)`: Creates a duration object from a specified amount and unit. The unit must either have an exact duration (like ChronoUnit.DAYS, which is treated as 24 hours) or throw an exception.

- `ofDays(days)`: Creates a duration object from a specified number of standard 24-hour days.

- `ofHours(hours)`: Creates a duration object from a specified number of standard hours.

- `ofMillis(millis)`: Creates a duration object from a specified number of milliseconds.

- `ofMinutes(minutes)`: Creates a duration object from a specified number of standard minutes.

- `ofNanos(nanos)`: Creates a duration object from a specified number of nanoseconds.


### Validation and Conversion

The library performs validation and conversion between different duration representations:

- `ToDurationRecord`: Converts input to a duration record with all fields set to zero, extracts and converts specific fields (days, hours, microseconds, etc.), and returns a valid duration record.

- `DurationSign`: Determines the sign of a duration based on the most significant non-zero field, returning -1, 0, or 1.

- `IsValidDuration`: Checks if provided duration fields represent a valid duration, returning true or false.
