# JavaScript Date Comparison: Best Practices and Methods

Understanding how to compare dates correctly in JavaScript is crucial for building reliable applications. A common mistake is comparing Date objects using the == or === operators, which only check if they're the same object rather than if they represent the same moment in time. This article explains the best practices for comparing dates, including direct Date comparison methods and working with the new Temporal library's PlainYearMonth class. We'll also explore common pitfalls and how to avoid issues when dealing with different date formats and calendar systems.


## Direct Date Comparison

Direct comparison of Date objects using == or === will not work correctly, returning false because these operators compare object references rather than their values (doc4). The correct way to compare Date objects is to use the getTime() method to convert them to the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC (doc5). For example, to check if two Date objects are equal, you should compare their getTime() values (doc5).

The getTime() method should be used with caution when comparing dates from different formats. For consistent string format "YYYY-MM", comparison can be done directly without conversion to Date objects (doc1). However, this approach requires all date strings to be in the same format and may produce unexpected results with different formats (doc5).

When working with Temporal.PlainYearMonth objects, the valueOf() method always throws a TypeError, preventing direct comparison (doc2). This design choice aims to prevent the implicit type conversion issues that have plagued JavaScript's Date object (doc7). To compare year-month values, developers must explicitly convert these objects to strings using the toString() method or use the static compare() method (doc2).

For precise date comparisons, developers should consider normalizing the Date objects by setting hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds to zero before performing the comparison (doc5). This approach ensures that only the year, month, and day components influence the comparison result.


## Date Object Comparison

The most reliable way to compare date objects in JavaScript is to use the getTime() method, which returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC (doc5, doc7). This approach ensures accurate comparisons by directly examining the underlying time value rather than comparing object references (doc4, doc7).

To compare two dates using this method:

1. Create two Date objects representing the dates to be compared.

2. Call the getTime() method on each Date object.

3. Compare the resulting numeric values using standard comparison operators.

For example:

```javascript

var date1 = new Date('2023-03-15');

var date2 = new Date('2023-03-20');

console.log(date1.getTime() < date2.getTime()) // true

```

This method works reliably with ISO 8601 date strings and direct Date object comparisons (doc7). However, it requires careful handling when comparing dates from different formats or time zones. To ensure accurate comparisons, it's recommended to normalize Date objects by setting hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds to zero before performing the comparison (doc7, doc5).


## Custom Date Comparison

For custom date formats, developers should convert the input strings to Date objects before comparing their components (year, month, day). This approach ensures accurate comparisons while maintaining the ability to work with actual date representations in the script.

The recommended method involves splitting the date string into month and year components, converting the month string to an integer, and creating a new Date object with these values (doc1). For example:

```javascript

var month = "Jan";

var year = 2015;

var formattedDate = new Date(year, month); // Note: months are 0-indexed in JavaScript

```

When comparing dates in "YYYY-MM-DD" format, developers can use integer comparison after removing hyphens (doc1):

```javascript

var d1 = "2020-12";

var d2 = "2021-01";

var greaterMth = d2 > d1 ? d2 : d1;

alert("Greater month is: " + greaterMth);

```

This approach works reliably for dates in YYYY-MM-DD format and continues to allow the use of Date objects for further operations. For more complex calculations or comparisons, developers may need to consider normalizing the Date objects by setting hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds to zero before performing the comparison (doc1, doc5).

When working with Temporal.PlainYearMonth objects, developers must manually convert the objects to strings using the toString() method or use the static compare() method (doc2, doc7). The valueOf() method always throws a TypeError, preventing direct comparison between instances (doc7). This design choice aligns with the Temporal library's goal of preventing implicit type conversion issues that have historically plagued JavaScript's Date object (doc2).


## Temporal.Calendar Methods

The Temporal library introduces specialized classes for working with date components, particularly the PlainYearMonth class. This class provides several advantages over traditional Date objects, including methods that handle calendar-specific comparisons without adjusting for calendar-specific details.


### Year-Month Conversion and Comparison

The key method for comparing PlainYearMonth objects is compare(), which returns -1 if the first month comes before the second, 0 if they start on the same date when projected into the ISO 8601 calendar, and 1 if the first month comes after the second. This method handles both single and multiple arguments, converting non-PlainYearMonth inputs using from().

For example:

```javascript

one = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2006-08')

two = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2015-07')

three = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('1930-02')

sorted = [one, two, three].sort(Temporal.PlainYearMonth.compare)

sorted.join(' ') // => '1930-02 2006-08 2015-07'

```


### Key Properties and Methods

The PlainYearMonth class includes several important properties and methods:

- **Properties**: year, month, monthCode, calendarId, era, eraYear

- **Methods**: from(), add(), equals(), toPlainDate(), toJSON(), toString(), toLocaleString(), until()


### Implementation Details

To create a PlainYearMonth object, you can use the static from() method with various input formats, including plain objects, strings, or other PlainYearMonth instances. The method supports different calendar systems and handles out-of-range values based on the specified overflow behavior.

For instance, creating a PlainYearMonth from an RFC 9557 string:

```javascript

let date = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2006-08')

```

The resulting object contains useful properties like daysInMonth and daysInYear, which provide calendar-specific details:

```javascript

date.daysInMonth // 31

date.daysInYear // 365

```


### Comparison Handling

When comparing dates across different calendar systems, PlainYearMonth provides a consistent approach by comparing the first day of each month in the ISO 8601 calendar system. This ensures that months starting on the same day, regardless of their calendar-specific properties, are considered equal:

```javascript

let gregorian = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('1582-10')

let islamic = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('1015-01')

gregorian.compare(islamic) // 0

```

This design choice simplifies cross-calendar comparisons while maintaining the underlying calendar-specific details in the object representation.


## Comparison Gotchas

JavaScript's == and !== operators should never be used to compare Date objects, as these operators compare object references rather than their values (MDN Web Docs: Temporal.PlainYearMonth.prototype.equals()). Instead, developers should use the getTime() method to compare the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1971 (00:00:00 UTC) (MDN Web Docs: Date.getTime()).

When working with Temporal.PlainYearMonth objects, developers must be aware that comparison and equality checks behave differently. The compare() method returns -1 if the first month comes before the second, 0 if they start on the same date when projected into the ISO 8601 calendar, and 1 if the first month comes after the second (MDN Web Docs: Temporal.PlainYearMonth.compare). In contrast, the equals() method returns true only if the year-month instances are equivalent in value and calendar system, meaning two year-months from different calendars may be considered equal by compare() but not by equals() (MDN Web Docs: Temporal.PlainYearMonth.prototype.equals()).

The PlainYearMonth class's valueOf() method always throws a TypeError, preventing direct comparison with other values using relational operators (<, <=, >, >=) (MDN Web Docs: Temporal.PlainYearMonth.prototype.valueOf()). To compare PlainYearMonth objects, developers should use the compare() method or the equals() method, which checks both date value and calendar system (MDN Web Docs: Temporal.PlainYearMonth.prototype.equals()). Developers should avoid using the constructor directly and prefer the from() method to set reference days, as two equivalent year-months with different reference days are considered different (MDN Web Docs: Temporal.PlainYearMonth.prototype.equals()).

For developers working with custom date formats, the daysInMonth property provides the number of days in the month, while inLeapYear returns true if the year-month is in a leap year (MDN Web Docs: Temporal.PlainYearMonth). The year and month properties represent the year and month values, respectively, with the month being 1-based (calendar-dependent) (MDN Web Docs: Temporal.PlainYearMonth). The calendarId property returns the calendar used to interpret the date, and the eraYear property returns the year index within the era, which can be 0-based or 1-based and may decrease in some calendars (MDN Web Docs: Temporal.PlainYearMonth).
