# JavaScript isNaN() Method & Number Checking

In JavaScript, the concept of NaN (Not-a-Number) plays a crucial role in handling mathematical operations and data validation. Understanding how to correctly identify and manage NaN values is essential for developing robust applications. This article explores the nuances of NaN in JavaScript, focusing on the global isNaN() function and the ECMAScript 6 Number.isNaN() method. We'll examine their key differences, behavior with various data types, and provide practical examples and polyfills for modern JavaScript development.


## Understanding NaN in JavaScript

NaN stands for "Not a Number" in JavaScript, representing a special floating-point value that indicates an undefined or unrepresentable value resulting from a mathematical operation. Key properties of NaN include:

- It cannot be equal to any value, including itself (`NaN !== NaN`)

- It is of type 'number' despite not being a standard numeric value

- Mathematical operations with NaN typically produce nonsensical results

The language includes multiple ways to check for NaN values, with the most commonly used methods being the global `isNaN()` function and the ECMAScript 6 `Number.isNaN()` method. These functions return true for values that would evaluate to NaN through `parseFloat`, such as results of failed type conversions or certain mathematical operations.


## isNaN() Method Overview

The global `isNaN()` function in JavaScript returns true if a value is NaN (Not-a-Number), which is a special floating-point value that signals an undefined or unrepresentable value resulting from a mathematical operation. It works by converting the value to a number and comparing it to NaN, making it suitable for checking if a value would evaluate to NaN through `parseFloat`.

Key behaviors of `isNaN()` include:

- It returns false for all non-NaN values

- It returns true for values that would evaluate to NaN through `parseFloat`, such as "geoff", {}, and undefined

- It correctly identifies NaN as unequal to itself (`NaN !== NaN`), unlike other values

For example:

```javascript

console.log(isNaN('geoff')); // true

console.log(isNaN({})); // true

console.log(isNaN(NaN)); // true

console.log(isNaN(0 / 0)); // true

console.log(isNaN('2005/12/12')); // true

```

While `isNaN()` provides a convenient way to check for NaN, it has limitations, particularly with modern JavaScript types. For instance, it throws an error when used with `BigInt` types. To address these limitations, the ECMAScript 6 `Number.isNaN()` method was introduced, providing similar functionality without parsing issues.

`Number.isNaN()` offers several advantages:

- It does not attempt to convert the parameter to a number, making it safer for use with complex values

- It returns false for non-number types, unlike `isNaN()` which returns true

- It correctly identifies NaN as the only value that is unequal to itself (`Number.isNaN(NaN) === true`, `Number.isNaN(0) === false`)

The method can be implemented using a simple comparison:

```javascript

Number.isNaN = Number.isNaN || function(value) {

  return value !== value;

}

```

This implementation can be used as a polyfill for environments supporting ECMAScript 5 to 6, ensuring consistent NaN checking across different JavaScript versions and environments.


## Number.isNaN Method

The ECMAScript 6 `Number.isNaN` method provides a robust way to check for NaN values by specifically targeting the Number.NaN value and returning true only when the input is a number that equals NaN. This method differs from the global `isNaN` function in that it does not attempt to convert the parameter to a number, making it safer for use with complex values.

Key behaviors of Number.isNaN include:

- Returns true for values that are exactly Number.NaN

- Returns false for all other values, including strings that cannot be converted to numbers

- Does not throw errors when used with complex types like BigInt

This precision makes Number.isNaN particularly useful in modern JavaScript development, where type safety is crucial. For example, while isNaN('2005/12/12') returns true due to the string format, Number.isNaN('2005/12/12') correctly returns false, preventing unnecessary value conversions.

When implementing Number.isNaN in older JavaScript environments, developers can use the following polyfill:

```javascript

Number.isNaN || (Number.isNaN = function(value) {

  return typeof value === "number" && value !== value;

})

```

This implementation checks if the value is a number and then uses the self-equality test to determine if it equals NaN. This approach ensures compatibility across different JavaScript versions while maintaining the robustness of the Number.isNaN method.


## Best Practices for NaN Checking

When working with number checking in JavaScript, it's crucial to understand the differences between `isNaN()` and `Number.isNaN()`. While `isNaN()` has widespread browser support, including in Internet Explorer, it has several limitations that make it less reliable for modern JavaScript development.

The fundamental issue with `isNaN()` is its coercion behavior. As noted in the documentation, this method returns true for a wide range of non-numeric values, including strings, objects, and functions. This behavior can lead to unexpected results when checking for NaN values, particularly in complex applications.

In contrast, `Number.isNaN()` provides precise control over NaN checking by only returning true when the input is a number that equals NaN. This method does not attempt to convert the parameter to a number, making it safer for use with complex values. For example, while `isNaN('2005/12/12')` returns true due to the string format, `Number.isNaN('2005/12/12')` correctly returns false, preventing unnecessary value conversions.

For developers working with JavaScript versions prior to ES6, the following polyfill implementation ensures consistent NaN checking across different environments:

```javascript

Number.isNaN || (Number.isNaN = function(value) {

  return typeof value === "number" && value !== value;

})

```

This implementation checks if the value is a number and then uses the self-equality test to determine if it equals NaN. This approach ensures compatibility across different JavaScript versions while maintaining the robustness of the Number.isNaN method.

To further improve NaN checking practices, developers can implement custom functions that combine type checking with value comparison. For instance, the following function provides a reliable way to determine if a value is not a number:

```javascript

function isNotANumber(n) {

  if (typeof n !== 'number') {

    return true;

  }

  return n !== n;

}

```

This custom function first checks if the value is not of number type and then uses the self-equality test to determine if it equals NaN. This approach provides clear and consistent results while avoiding the limitations of the built-in isNaN() method.

For applications specifically targeting NaN checking in mathematical contexts, the Math.abs() function serves as a useful reference point. When passed a non-numeric value, Math.abs() returns NaN, as demonstrated in the following code snippet:

```javascript

var totn_number = 'ABC123';

if (Number.isNaN(Math.abs(totn_number))) {

  console.log('abs parameter was not a number');

} else {

  console.log('abs parameter was a number');

}

```

This implementation produces the expected output of "abs parameter was not a number," highlighting the value's non-numeric nature.

When working with date strings or other complex input formats, developers can use a combination of type checking and value conversion to ensure accurate NaN detection. The following example demonstrates a practical approach to checking if a date string represents a valid number:

```javascript

function isNumber(v) {

  return Number.isNaN(parseFloat(v));

}

```

This function first attempts to parse the input as a floating-point number and then uses the built-in Number.isNaN() method to check for NaN values. This approach provides a reliable way to determine if a value represents a valid number while avoiding the limitations of the standard isNaN() method.


## Polyfills and Browser Support

In JavaScript, the `Number.isNaN()` function, introduced in ECMAScript 6, provides a more reliable way to check for NaN values compared to the older `isNaN()` method. While `isNaN()` has been available in all modern browsers since June 2017, it has limitations that make it less suitable for contemporary JavaScript development.

A simple implementation of Number.isNaN() can be used as a polyfill for environments supporting ECMAScript 5 to 6:

```javascript

Number.isNaN || (Number.isNaN = function(value) {

  return value !== value;

})

```

This implementation ensures compatibility across different JavaScript versions while maintaining the precision of the Number.isNaN method. However, for developers targeting older environments, the following polyfill provides a more robust solution:

```javascript

Number.isNaN = Number.isNaN || function(value) {

  return typeof value === "number" && value !== value;

}

```

This version first checks if the value is a number before performing the NaN test, avoiding false positives for non-numeric inputs.

The ECMAScript specification defines Number.isNaN() as returning true only when its parameter is NaN, making it distinct from the globally scoped isNaN() function, which attempts to convert the parameter to a number before testing. This difference in behavior can lead to unexpected results using the older method, particularly with complex types like BigInt:

- `isNaN(NaN)` returns true

- `Number.isNaN(NaN)` returns true

- `isNaN('NaN')` returns true

- `Number.isNaN('NaN')` returns false

- `Number.isNaN(123)` returns false

- `isNaN(123)` returns false

Developers working with date strings or other non-numeric data can use a combination of type checking and value conversion to ensure accurate NaN detection. For example, a custom function combining these techniques can provide clear and consistent results:

```javascript

function isNotANumber(n) {

  if (typeof n !== 'number') {

    return true;

  }

  return n !== n;

}

```

This approach ensures reliable NaN checking while avoiding the limitations of the standard isNaN() method. When testing mathematical expressions that may produce NaN, developers can use functions like Math.abs() as a reference point:

```javascript

var totn_number = 'ABC123';

if (Number.isNaN(Math.abs(totn_number))) {

  console.log('abs parameter was not a number');

} else {

  console.log('abs parameter was a number');

}

```

This implementation correctly identifies the non-numeric input, demonstrating the value's non-numeric nature.
