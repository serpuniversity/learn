# JavaScript Date Reference: getFullYear() Method

The JavaScript Date object offers numerous methods for date manipulation and retrieval, one of which is the getFullYear() method. This method returns the year of the specified date according to local time, represented as a four-digit number. While similar methods handle other date components, getFullYear() provides a comprehensive solution for year representation. This article explores the functionality, syntax, and compatibility of getFullYear(), demonstrating its importance in modern JavaScript applications.


## getFullYear() Method Overview

The getFullYear() method returns the year of the specified date according to local time, represented as a four-digit number between 1000 and 9999. This method has been available across browsers since July 2015 and is part of the ECMAScript 2026 Language Specification.

While similar methods such as getMonth() and getDate() are available for other date components, getFullYear() stands out for its comprehensive year representation. The method works seamlessly with existing Date objects, as demonstrated by this example:

```javascript

let dateobj = new Date('October 15, 1996 05:35:32');

let year = dateobj.getFullYear();

console.log(year); // Output: 1996

```

When called with no parameters, as in the following example, getFullYear() returns the current year:

```javascript

let dateobj = new Date();

let year = dateobj.getFullYear();

console.log(year); // Output will be the current year

```

The method follows a straightforward syntax: `dateObj.getFullYear()`. This syntax demonstrates its ease of use while maintaining a clear and consistent API design.

For developers working across different browsers and environments, getFullYear() provides reliable year information, with official support dating back to July 2015 in major browsers. This longevity ensures consistent behavior across various JavaScript implementations, making it a solid choice for year retrieval in modern JavaScript applications.


## Basic Usage

The getFullYear() method returns the year of the specified date according to local time, represented as a four-digit number between 1000 and 9999. This method has been available across browsers since July 2015 and is part of the ECMAScript 2026 Language Specification.

The method's basic usage is straightforward. It can be applied to an existing Date object or used with the new Date() constructor to retrieve the current year. For example, new Date().getFullYear() returns the current year when called with no parameters. When applied to a specific date object, it returns the year of that date. For instance:

```javascript

let dateobj = new Date('October 15, 1996 05:35:32');

let year = dateobj.getFullYear();

console.log(year); // Output: 1996

```

When called with no parameters, as in the following example, getFullYear() returns the current year:

```javascript

let dateobj = new Date();

let year = dateobj.getFullYear();

console.log(year); // Output will be the current year

```

The method's syntax is `dateObj.getFullYear()`, demonstrating its ease of use while maintaining a clear and consistent API design. While similar methods such as getMonth() and getDate() are available for other date components, getFullYear() stands out for its comprehensive year representation.

The method returns a number representing the year of the given date according to local time. It replaces the deprecated getYear() method and returns an integer for dates between 1000 and 9999. The returned value is a four-digit number, as demonstrated by the example using December 25, 1995 23:15:00, which returns 1995 when passed through getFullYear().


## Leap Year Considerations

When adding one year to February 29th of a leap year, getFullYear() correctly returns March 1st of the following year. This functionality ensures proper date progression during the transition from February 29th to March 1st in leap years.

However, attempting to add years to dates where the day of the month is outside the valid range (1-31) results in NaN. For example, if a date is set to October 45, 1996, getFullYear() returns NaN. This behavior demonstrates the method's validation of date parameters, although it highlights potential issues when working with invalid date configurations.


## Alternative Methods

While getFullYear() is the recommended method for obtaining the full year, alternative approaches include using the setFullYear() method for date manipulation or working with universal time using getUTCFullYear().

The setFullYear() method provides comprehensive control over the year, month, and day of month for a specified date. Its syntax allows three different usage patterns:

1. setFullYear(yearValue) - Sets the year, month, and day of month for the date.

2. setFullYear(yearValue, monthValue) - Sets the year and month for the date, with the day of month remaining unchanged.

3. setFullYear(yearValue, monthValue, dateValue) - Sets all three components of the date.

The method returns the updated timestamp of the Date object, or NaN if any parameter is outside the expected range. For example:

```javascript

const dateobj = new Date('October 15, 1996 05:35:32');

dateobj.setFullYear(2000); // Sets year to 2000, month to October, day to 15

const updatedYear = dateobj.getFullYear(); // Returns 2000

```

The getUTCFullYear() method offers an alternative for working with universal time, returning the four-digit year of the specified date according to universal time. This method follows the same four-digit year format as getFullYear() for dates between 1000 and 9999. For example:

```javascript

const dateobj = new Date('October 15, 1996 05:35:32');

const utcYear = dateobj.getUTCFullYear(); // Returns 1996

```

These alternative methods provide flexibility in date manipulation while maintaining compatibility with the primary getFullYear() method. Together, they enable developers to work effectively with date components in JavaScript applications.


## Browser Compatibility

The getFullYear() method is widely supported across major browsers, with full compatibility dating back to July 2015. According to the latest specifications, the method is available in the following environments:

- Chrome: Full support since version 1

- Edge: Full support since version 12

- Firefox: Full support since version 1

- Internet Explorer: Full support since version 4

This broad compatibility makes getFullYear() a reliable choice for year retrieval in JavaScript applications, with support spanning multiple versions of major web browsers and development environments. The method's long-standing availability ensures consistent behavior across different JavaScript implementations, providing developers with a robust foundation for date-based calculations and applications.
