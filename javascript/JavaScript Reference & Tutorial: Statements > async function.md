# Master JavaScript Asynchronous Programming with async and await

As JavaScript applications grow in complexity, mastering asynchronous programming becomes crucial for building responsive and efficient web applications. The introduction of async and await keywords in ES2017 brought significant improvements to JavaScript's promise-based model, making asynchronous code more manageable while maintaining performance. This article explores the fundamentals of async/await, demonstrating how these features transform complex promise chains into cleaner, more maintainable code. We'll examine their behavior, best practices, and real-world applications, helping developers leverage these powerful tools effectively.


## Understanding async/await: Making asynchronous code appear synchronous

An async function always returns a Promise. This fundamental behavior means that any value returned by an async function is automatically wrapped in a resolved Promise, making it consistent with how Promise-returning functions behave. This automatic wrapping occurs even when no explicit return statement is used, with the function implicitly returning `undefined` if nothing is returned explicitly.

The basic structure of an async function follows this pattern: when execution enters an async function, a new Promise is created to represent the eventual return value. The function's body is executed normally, with each await expression creating a new step in the promise chain. When the function exits (either permanently or temporarily via await), its Promise is settled with either a fulfillment value or a rejection reason.

Error handling in async functions is straightforward yet powerful. When a promise inside an async function fulfills, the await expression returns the fulfillment value. Conversely, if a promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejection reason, providing a clean mechanism for error propagation using familiar try/catch blocks. This behavior aligns closely with native JavaScript error handling mechanisms, making it intuitive for developers familiar with synchronous code structures.

The syntax allows for versatile promise handling. Where traditional promise chains might require nested .then() methods or complex error chaining, async/await provides a simpler, more intuitive approach. For instance, handling multiple asynchronous operations can be achieved using a single try/catch block around the entire async function, or by chaining multiple await expressions that are bundled together for error handling.

Modern browsers support top-level await within modules, making it possible to use promises directly at the top level of a module instead of wrapping everything in an anonymous async function. This functionality extends the power of async/await to scenarios beyond traditional function declarations, allowing for more flexible and elegant asynchronous programming patterns.


## async function basics: Syntax and asynchronous function behavior

async functions always return promises, while await expressions pause execution until promises resolve or reject. This section explores the fundamental behavior of async functions and the role of await expressions in JavaScript's promise-based programming model.

The core mechanism of an async function is its promise-returning behavior. When an async function completes execution, it returns a promise that will resolve to whatever value the function explicitly returns. If the function completes normally without an explicit return, it implicitly returns undefined, which is then wrapped in a resolved promise.

A key characteristic of async functions is their treatment of non-promise return values. Any value returned from an async function is automatically wrapped in a resolved promise, making the function's return value fundamentally different from a plain Promise object. This distinction affects equality checks and must be considered when working with async function results.

The underlying mechanism of async functions is closely tied to how JavaScript handles promises. An async function creates a new Promise when it begins execution. The function's body is processed synchronously until the first await expression, at which point control is yielded to the promise. When an await expression is encountered, the function's execution is paused, and control returns to the caller. Once the awaited promise settles, execution resumes where it left off.

The interaction between await and promise resolution is a critical aspect of async function behavior. When an await expression is evaluated, it waits for the promise to settle. If the promise is fulfilled, the value is returned to the awaiting expression. If the promise is rejected, the rejection reason is thrown, providing a clean mechanism for error propagation through the async function's completion handler.

An important aspect of async function implementation is their handling of control flow. The function body is processed in stages, with each await expression creating a new step in the promise chain. The flow of execution moves through the function in stages, with control yielding between await expressions to allow other tasks to proceed. This mechanism enables more efficient use of CPU resources by allowing JavaScript engines to schedule other operations during these yield points.


## Working with async functions: Best practices and common patterns

async functions enable efficient performance by managing object allocations carefully. When an async function encounters a synchronous result, the function may lead to performance issues due to object allocations, particularly in tight loops or when processing non-promise values. To optimize these scenarios, developers can use alternative structures like ValueTask<TResult>, which is a structure that doesn't lead to object allocation, enhancing both performance and memory efficiency.

Best practices for error handling emphasize the importance of proper exception management. Always handle exceptions using try..catch blocks within asynchronous methods to prevent unhandled exceptions, which can destabilize the application. For managing promise rejections, the recommended approach is to use try/catch blocks for expected errors within async functions, while unexpected errors should be handled by adding a catch() block to the calling function. This separation ensures that common errors are neatly contained while keeping the code maintainable.

Concurrency management requires careful consideration to prevent resource exhaustion. Developers should avoid creating excessive parallelism with async operations, as too many concurrent tasks can overwhelm system resources. Implementing proper cancellation mechanisms with cancellation tokens allows users to interrupt long-running operations gracefully. For managing multiple async operations, consider using Promise.all to run them concurrently rather than waiting for each to complete sequentially, which can significantly improve performance in certain scenarios.

When integrating async functions into larger code structures, it's crucial to minimize mixing synchronous and asynchronous code within the same method. This practice helps maintain code clarity and consistency, making it easier to reason about and debug. Additionally, take advantage of JavaScript's top-level await functionality introduced in ES2022, which allows using await at the top level in ES modules. This feature simplifies the integration of asynchronous code without resorting to additional wrappers, promoting cleaner and more maintainable codebases.


## async and await in depth: Technical specifications and browser compatibility

The `async` keyword before a function indicates that the function always returns a promise. When an async function completes execution, it returns a new Promise that will settle with the value returned by the function. This behavior applies even if the function body returns a non-promise value, which is automatically wrapped in resolved promise.

Non-promise return values behave differently when compared to explicitly returned promises:

```javascript

async function foo() { return 1; } // Returns a resolved promise that fulfills with 1

async function bar() { return Promise.resolve(1); } // Explicitly returns a resolved promise that fulfills with 1

```

Despite their similar behavior, these two examples have distinct differences:

```javascript

const value = foo().then(result => console.log(result)); // Logs 1

const value = bar().then(result => console.log(result)); // Logs [Promise] with a status of "fulfilled"

```

In the first example, the `foo` function's return value is directly accessible via the promise's resolution. In the second example, accessing the promise's value requires unwrapping the explicitly returned promise.

The async function declaration creates an AsyncFunction object, similar to regular function declarations. These objects behave similarly to function declarations in terms of hoisting and scope, allowing them to be called anywhere within their scope. However, async functions differ in their redeclaration rules, which are limited to certain contexts.

The execution flow of an async function consists of three stages:

1. Top-level code runs synchronously up to the first await expression

2. Functions without await execute synchronously

3. Functions with await expressions execute asynchronously

Between await expressions, the async function's execution is temporarily paused, and control is yielded to another task. During this yield point, the JavaScript engine can schedule other operations, which helps in efficient resource management. The body of the async function is divided into multiple stages, with each await expression creating a new execution context and promise in the chain.

This mechanism allows for improved performance by minimizing object allocations. When an async function encounters a synchronous result, it can directly return the value without creating additional objects, particularly in tight loops or when processing non-promise values.

The behavior of async functions is consistent with JavaScript's promise-based programming model. An async function creates a new Promise when it begins execution and ensures that all return values are properly wrapped in resolved promises. This consistent behavior aligns with other promise-returning functions and maintains JavaScript's promise ecosystem, including support for existing promise methods like .then(), .catch(), and .finally().


## Real-world implementation: Using async/await in JavaScript applications

The `demoGithubUser` function demonstrates a practical application of async/await in handling asynchronous HTTP requests with proper error management. This example prompts the user for a GitHub username, attempting to fetch user details via the GitHub API until valid user data is obtained. The function gracefully handles 404 errors by prompting the user to re-enter a valid username, ensuring a smooth user experience.

```javascript

async function demoGithubUser() {

  let user;

  while(true) {

    let name = prompt("Enter a name?", "iliakan");

    try {

      user = await loadJson(`https://api.github.com/users/${name}`);

      break; // no error, exit loop

    } catch(err) {

      if (err instanceof HttpError && err.response.status == 404) {

        alert("No such user, please reenter.");

      } else {

        throw err;

      }

    }

  }

  alert(`Full name: ${user.name}.`);

  return user;

}

```

Another example showcases using async functions with `Promise.all` to run multiple asynchronous operations concurrently. This pattern optimizes performance by allowing parallel execution of database queries, which is particularly useful for operations that can run independently. The `delay` helper function simulates different execution times for each query, demonstrating how to structure asynchronous task execution in real-world applications.

```javascript

async function run() {

  connect();

  try {

    await Promise.all([

      delay(() => database.query(true), 100),

      delay(() => database.query(false), 200),

      delay(() => database.query(false), 300)

    ]);

  } catch(err) {

    console.error(err);

  }

}

```

These practical examples highlight the benefits of async/await in making asynchronous code more readable and maintainable while maintaining efficient execution patterns suitable for modern JavaScript applications.
