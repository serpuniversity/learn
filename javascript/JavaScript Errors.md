# JavaScript AggregateError: Managing Multiple Errors

JavaScript's AggregateError provides a robust solution for managing multiple errors through a single exception object. This native feature, introduced to address the limitations of traditional error handling, offers enhanced debugging capabilities and simplified error management within try/catch blocks. Understanding how to effectively use AggregateError, from its construction and properties to its implementation in Promise.any(), is crucial for modern JavaScript development. This article examines the AggregateError constructor, its properties, and methods, while also addressing best practices and common pitfalls for developers implementing this essential error-handling mechanism.


## AggregateError Overview

AggregateError provides a structured way to handle multiple errors in JavaScript, consolidating them into a single exception object. This error type collects and throws multiple validation errors together, offering improved debugging information and simplified error handling through a single try/catch block.

The AggregateError object represents multiple errors in a single instance, storing them in an array accessible through the `errors` property. This property contains the individual error messages, which can be an array of Error objects or other error-compatible structures like strings or objects.

When creating an AggregateError, developers can optionally provide a custom message and an options object containing a `cause` property. The constructor supports both Error and non-Error objects, with strings being converted into Error instances with the provided message.

Key usage patterns include:

```javascript

// Basic construction

const error = new AggregateError([new Error("foo"), "bar", { message: "baz" }]);

// Catch block example

Promise.any([Promise.reject(new Error("error 1")), Promise.reject(new Error("error 2"))]).catch((err) =>

  console.log(`${err.message}:`, err.errors)

);

```

This pattern enables developers to aggregate and report multiple error scenarios, such as form validation or parallel API requests, while maintaining clear debugging information through the error stack and message properties.


## Constructor and Properties

The AggregateError constructor creates an error from multiple errors or a single error message. It supports both Error and non-Error objects, with strings being converted into Error instances using the provided message.

The constructor takes three parameters:

- errors: An iterable of errors, which may not be actual Error instances

- message: Optional human-readable description of the aggregate error

- options: Optional object with a cause property indicating the specific error cause

When creating an AggregateError, the constructor can be called with or without the new keyword. It returns an Error object representing the aggregated errors.

The instance properties include:

- name: Displays the error name, defaulting to "AggregateError"

- errors: An array containing the aggregated errors, retaining the order of the input iterable

- original: A deprecated alias for the cause property

- parent: Another deprecated alias for the cause property

- message: Displays the error message, defaulting to an empty string

Instance methods include:

- toString: Returns a string representation of the object

- constructor: References the AggregateError constructor

The AggregateError object is widely implemented across modern browsers, with support available since September 2020. For environments without native support, polyfills are available in libraries such as core-js and es-shims.


## Usage in Promise.any

The AggregateError constructor is specifically designed to work with Promise.any(). When multiple promises reject, this method utilizes AggregateError to aggregate the errors into a single object.

The built-in JavaScript method Promise.any() allows requesting data from multiple APIs while using the result of the first successful promise. If all input promises fail, Promise.any() rejects with an AggregateError object. This error object then provides a structured way to handle multiple rejection reasons.

The AggregateError object has a standardized structure with the following properties:

- name: Displays the error name, defaulting to "AggregateError"

- errors: An array containing the aggregated errors, maintaining the order of the input iterable

- message: Displays the error message, defaulting to an empty string

Additionally, the AggregateError object features methods that inherit from its parent Error object, including:

- constructor: References the AggregateError constructor

- toString: Returns a string representation of the object

Handling AggregateError follows a consistent pattern:

```javascript

Promise.any([fetch("/data-location1"), fetch("/data-location2"), fetch("/data-location3")])

  .catch((error) => {

    console.error(error.name); // "AggregateError"

    console.error(error.message); // "All promises were rejected"

    console.error(error.errors); // [Error, Error, Error]

  });

```

This approach enables developers to efficiently manage multiple promise rejections while maintaining clear debugging information through the error stack and message properties.


## Browser Support and Compatibility

The ECMAScript 2026 Language Specification defines AggregateError as a fundamental object type for managing multiple errors. The specification details that AggregateError represents an error when several errors need to be wrapped in a single object, typically occurring when multiple promises reject.

Browser support for AggregateError has been established since September 2020, though full compatibility varies. Modern browsers implement the feature reliably, but developers working in older environments should consider polyfills. Core-js provides a comprehensive implementation, while es-shims offers a specialized AggregateError polyfill.

The AggregateError constructor can be called with or without the new keyword, creating an instance of the error type. It accepts three parameters: an iterable of errors, an optional message string, and optional options with a cause property. The constructor supports both Error and non-Error objects, with strings being converted into Error instances using the provided message.

The AggregateError object maintains the structure of its error collection through several key properties. The errors property contains an array of the aggregated errors, preserving the order of the input iterable. The name property displays "AggregateError", while the message property defaults to an empty string. Additional properties include original, which is deprecated and should be replaced with cause, and parent, another deprecated alias for cause. The object also inherits standard Error methods like constructor and toString, providing consistent error handling across JavaScript applications.


## Best Practices and Gotchas

AggregateError provides several best practices for developers managing multiple errors:


### Centralized Error Collection

When multiple validation errors need to be reported, use AggregateError to collect all errors into a single object. This avoids the need for separate catch blocks, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.


### Standardized Error Handling

Use AggregateError with Promise.any() to handle multiple promise rejections in a standardized way. The method returns an AggregateError when all promises fail, ensuring consistent error handling across the application.


### Clear Debugging Information

When creating an AggregateError, include a custom message and error details. The message property displays the error description, while the errors array contains all individual error objects. The name property defaults to "AggregateError" for easy identification.


### Limitations in Console Logging

AggregateError has specific behaviors when used with console logs. Avoid nesting AggregateError objects using `{cause: new AggregateError()}` as it can cause issues with individual error details. Instead, ensure the console logs all error messages and causes for effective troubleshooting.


### Browser Compatibility

Check for native support before implementing AggregateError. For broader compatibility, use polyfills from libraries like core-js or es-shims. Always test in the target environment to ensure proper error handling and display.
