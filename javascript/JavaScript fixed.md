# JavaScript String fixed() Method

In JavaScript, strings are fundamental data types essential for web development and client-side scripting. The language provides numerous built-in methods to manipulate strings, allowing developers to perform tasks such as extracting substrings, replacing text, and formatting output. Understanding these string methods is crucial for building dynamic and interactive web applications.

However, not all string manipulation techniques remain relevant or recommended in modern JavaScript development. The fixed() method, which creates HTML <tt> elements to display text in a fixed-width font, falls into this category. While it may still work across different browsers, the method is deprecated and its use is discouraged due to changes in HTML standards.

This article explores the fixed() method in detail, examining its implementation, behavior, and historical context. We'll compare it to more modern string manipulation techniques and CSS properties, helping developers understand when to use each approach and why certain methods have fallen out of favor. By the end of this discussion, you'll have a clear understanding of how to handle string formatting in JavaScript while writing code that remains compatible with future developments in web standards.


## Overview of JavaScript String Methods

The fixed() method in JavaScript is a deprecated string method that creates an HTML <tt> element. It is a method of the String object and must be invoked through a particular instance of the String class. The method returns a copy of the string enclosed in <tt> and </tt> tags. The syntax for the fixed() method is string.fixed(), which takes no parameters or arguments.

For example:

```javascript

var totn_string = 'TechOnTheNet';

console.log(totn_string.fixed());

```

Output:

```

<tt>TechOnTheNet</tt>

```

The value of the totn_string variable is enclosed within the <tt> and </tt> tags. This method causes the string to be displayed in a fixed-width font as if it were in a <tt> tag.

The fixed() method is deprecated and only standardized for compatibility purposes. The <tt> element itself has been removed from the HTML specification and should not be used anymore. Web developers should use CSS properties instead, such as manipulating font-family through the element.style attribute.

As noted in the documentation, using the fixed() method creates invalid HTML markup when used directly, as <tt> is no longer a valid element. For example:

```javascript

const contentString = "Hello, world";

document.body.innerHTML = contentString.fixed();

```

This will create the following HTML:

```html

<tt>Hello, world</tt>

```

The markup is invalid because <tt> is no longer a valid element. Instead, developers should use CSS to manipulate fonts. For example:

```javascript

document.getElementById("yourElemId").style.fontFamily = "monospace";

```

However, for actual string manipulation tasks, JavaScript offers a variety of other methods. The substring() and substr() methods allow extracting parts of strings, while the split() method can break a string into an array of substrings. Modern alternatives for formatting include the padStart() and padEnd() methods for adding leading or trailing spaces, and the toLocaleLowerCase() and toLocaleUpperCase() methods for case conversion, which provide better locale support than the traditional toLowerCase() and toUpperCase() methods.


## The fixed() Method

The fixed() method is a string method in JavaScript that creates an HTML <tt> element. It was implemented in JavaScript 1.0 and requires no parameters. The syntax for the method is simply string.fixed(), which returns a copy of the string enclosed in <tt> and </tt> tags.

The method causes a string to be displayed in fixed-pitch font as if it were in a <tt> tag. For example:

```javascript

var totn_string = 'TechOnTheNet';

console.log(totn_string.fixed());

```

This will output:

```

<tt>TechOnTheNet</tt>

```

The JavaScript String object's fixed() method has been supported across multiple browsers including Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 3.6, Google Chrome 7, Safari 5.0.1, and Opera 10.

However, it's important to note that the <tt> tag is no longer supported in HTML5 and the fixed() method is deprecated. When used directly, it creates invalid HTML markup. For example:

```javascript

const contentString = "Hello, world";

document.body.innerHTML = contentString.fixed();

```

This will output:

```html

<tt>Hello, world</tt>

```

Web developers should use CSS properties instead, such as manipulating font-family through the element.style attribute. For instance:

```javascript

document.getElementById("yourElemId").style.fontFamily = "monospace";

```

The fixed() method creates a string that begins with a <tt> start tag, contains the text of the original string, and ends with a </tt> end tag. This behavior makes it useful for simple string formatting tasks, though developers are encouraged to use more modern and flexible alternatives for font styling and manipulation.


## String Formatting with fixed()

The fixed() method creates a string enclosed in <tt> tags, which displays the text in a fixed-width font as if it were within a <tt> element. Here are several examples demonstrating how to use the fixed() method:

```javascript

var example = 'JavaScript String Methods';

console.log(example.fixed()); // <tt>JavaScript String Methods</tt>

```

The method returns a new string with the <tt> tags, leaving the original string unchanged:

```javascript

var original = 'Hello World';

var formatted = original.fixed();

console.log(formatted); // <tt>Hello World</tt>

console.log(original); // Hello World

```

This basic functionality makes fixed() useful for simple string formatting tasks. However, as noted in the documentation, the <tt> element is no longer supported in HTML5, and using fixed() directly creates invalid markup:

```javascript

const contentString = "Hello, world";

document.body.innerHTML = contentString.fixed();

```

This generates the following HTML, which is invalid:

```html

<tt>Hello, world</tt>

```

For proper font styling and manipulation, developers should use CSS properties instead. For example, to set a monospace font:

```javascript

document.getElementById("yourElemId").style.fontFamily = "monospace";

```


### String Paddi


## The Future of JavaScript String Formatting

While the fixed() method remains supported for compatibility reasons, its usage is deprecated and should be avoided for new development projects. Modern web development best practices recommend using CSS properties for font manipulation, as demonstrated by the example:

```javascript

document.getElementById("yourElemId").style.fontFamily = "monospace";

```

Other modern JavaScript string methods offer more flexible and efficient alternatives for formatting tasks. The padStart() and padEnd() methods allow adding leading or trailing spaces to strings, ensuring the desired length is maintained:

```javascript

var original = "Hello";

var padded = original.padStart(10, "World"); // "WorldHello"

console.log(padded);

```

This functionality does not rely on deprecated HTML tags and provides better compatibility across different browsers and devices. Developers looking to format their strings should consider these modern alternatives, which offer improved functionality and maintain cleaner, more maintainable code.


## Related String Methods


### String Properties and Methods

Strings in JavaScript are treated as objects and provide numerous methods for manipulation. These include at(), charAt(), charCodeAt(), and codePointAt() for accessing characters and their Unicode values. The concat() method joins multiple strings, while the constructor() method returns the string's constructor function.


### Common String Operations

The endsWith() method checks if a string ends with a specified value, returning a boolean. fromCharCode() converts Unicode values to characters, and includes() returns whether a string contains a specified value. The indexOf() method finds the first occurrence of a value, while lastIndexOf() finds the last occurrence.


### Character and String Extraction

The length() method returns the string's length. localeCompare() compares strings in the current locale, match() searches for values or regular expressions, and padEnd() and padStart() pad strings from the end and start, respectively.


### String Conversion

toLocaleLowerCase() and toLocaleUpperCase() convert strings to lowercase and uppercase using the host's locale. The substring() method extracts characters between two indices, while slice() (preferred over substr()) extracts parts of strings.


### Array Conversion

The split() method converts strings to arrays using specified separators. For example, split(",") splits on commas, split(" ") on spaces, and split("|") on pipe characters. If no separator is specified, the array contains the entire string. If the separator is "", the array contains individual characters.


### Modern String Manipulation

The replace() method replaces specified values with others, returning a new string. By default, it only replaces the first match, but a regular expression with the /g flag replaces all matches. In 2021, JavaScript introduced replaceAll(), which allows replacing with regular expressions and requires the global flag.


### Implementation Examples

For converting strings to arrays, the following implementations demonstrate different approaches:

- Using split(): `text.split(",")`

- Using split() with multiple characters: `text.split(" ")`

- Using split() with no arguments: `text.split("")`

These examples provide comprehensive coverage of JavaScript string properties, methods, and modern implementations, offering developers a robust toolkit for string manipulation in modern web development.
